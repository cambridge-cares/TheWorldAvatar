HighPerformanceLiquidChromatography,Class,https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontolab/LabEquipment,IS-A,,,,"A separation technique in which the mobile phase is a liquid. Liquid chromatography can be carried out either in a column or on a plane. Present-day liquid chromatography generally utilizing very small particles and a relatively high inlet pressure is often characterized by the term high-performance (or high-pressure) liquid chromatography, and the acronym HPLC.
