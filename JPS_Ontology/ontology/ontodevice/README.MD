# Take Note!!!

Some definitions that have been defined in other ontologies are included here as a work-around to create the correct domain/range definitions in the OWL file. For example, om:Acceleration rdfs:subClassOf om:Quantity etc.

The removal of the redundant definitions will affect the domain/range definitions of these properties in ontodevice:
