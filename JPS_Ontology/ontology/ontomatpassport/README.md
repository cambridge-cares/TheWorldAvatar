## Ontology for Material Passport (OntoMatPassport) ##
OntoMatPassport is a generic ontology that represents the common properties of the material passport of a product or component across applications in the automotive, wind turbine blade, and electronic industries. It is also known as an ontology for materials and products life-cycle (OntoMPLC) representation. The life cycle is managed via the temporal aspect of the material passport of a product or component.

## Application ##
OntoMatPassport can be used to represent data to calculate the material circularity indicator of a product or component. OntoAutoMatPassport, OntoWTBladePassport, and OntoPCBMatPassport are application ontologies created by extending OntoMatPassport (OntoMPLC) to support the representation of automotive, wind turbine blade, and printed circuit board applications-specific data, respectively.
