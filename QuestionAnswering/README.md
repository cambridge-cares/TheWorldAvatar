Question-Answering systems are systems that search for answers in a knowledge base based on user queries. The World Avatar also offers these systems on top of the underlying dynamic knowledge graph technology to improve accuracy and accessibility. This folder contains all the various iterations of these systems, and users can refer to the latest iteration [QA_ICL](./QA_ICL/) for the latest developments.
