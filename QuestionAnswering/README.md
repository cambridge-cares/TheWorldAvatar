Question-Answering systems are systems that search for answers in a knowledge base based on user queries. The World Avatar also offers these systems on top of the underlying dynamic knowledge graph technology to improve accuracy and accessibility. This sub-repository contains all the various iterations of these systems, and users can refer to the latest iteration [QA_ICL](./QA_ICL/) for the latest developments.
