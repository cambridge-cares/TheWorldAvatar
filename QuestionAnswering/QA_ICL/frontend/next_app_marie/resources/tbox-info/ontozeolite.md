title: OntoZeolite and OntoCrystal
---

OntoZeolite and OntoCrystal are semantically interconnected ontologies to represent information on zeolite materials and integrate it with information on zeolite topologies and their construction, crystalline information and information on non-framework chemical species functioning as guest or charge-balancing ions. 

The OntoZeolite ontology provides a structured framework that contextualises zeolites-related knowledge. Its core concept - ZeoliteFramework - is used to instantiate information about individual framework types (e.g. FAU, LTA, NAT etc.) and connects to topological properties, synthesised zeolites, as well as crystal information.

The OntoCrystal ontology provides a semantic representation of crystallographic data. The central concept in the OntoCrystal ontology, CrystalInformation, is used to store fundamental crystallographic information and aggregates data from five key classes: UnitCell, XRDSpectrum, AtomicStructure, CoordinateTransformation, and TiledStructure.
