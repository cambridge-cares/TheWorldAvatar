This website presents a proof-of-concept search engine system for accessing chemical data from the World Avatar Knowledge Graph. The Knowledge Graphs offers inter-connected data from chemical kinetics to chemical and physical properties of species and many other domains.

Marie offers multiple interaction modes to cater to different user needs:

* Type a question into the field below to use the search engine or select one of the provided sample questions.
* Utilize the Advanced Search page to conduct detailed searches by defining filters and ranges for specific properties. This mode provides a more targeted approach to data retrieval.
* The Explore page enables users to visually explore and plot properties of chemical species and zeolites, offering a graphical representation of data for enhanced analysis.

Please note that Marie is still under development and the accuracy of the results will increase with further refinement of the underlying ontologies. We welcome feedback and suggestions as we work to refine and expand its capabilities.
