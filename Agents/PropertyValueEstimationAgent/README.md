# Property Value Estimation Agent (as Derivation Agent)


The `Property Value Estimation` agent uses the Derived Information Framework to calculate the latest market value estimate of properties (i.e. buildings and flats) instantiated in [The World Avatar] KG according to the [OntoBuiltEnv] ontology. The required building data comprises `total floor area` (from the [EPC Agent]) as well as previous `sales transaction records` and the `property price index` (from the [HM Land Registry Agent]) and needs to be instantiated beforehand. 

Both the **EPC Instantiation Agent** and the **HM Land Registry Instantiation Agent** are designed to continuously update the information in the KG. New [Energy Performance Certificate data] is released every 4-6 months while the [HM Land Registry Open Data] is updated monthly. Furthermore, the `average square metre price per postcode` is used for properties without any previous sales transactions. The [Average Square Metre Price Agent] (also implemented as Derivation Agent) updates this property automatically in the KG whenever new information gets instantiated.

The agent is implemented as Docker container to be deployed to a Docker stack spun up by the [Stack Manager]. It is recommended to use `VS Code` to develop/deploy the agent. Hence, a few of the details below are VS Code specific.

&nbsp;
# 1. Setup

This section specifies the minimum requirements to build and deploy the Docker image of the agent. 

&nbsp;
## 1.1 Prerequisites

Before building and deploying the Docker image, several key properties need to be set in the [Docker compose file] (further details and defaults are provided in the file). For details on the [Derivation Agent configuration] please refer to the official documentation.

### **1) The environment variables used by the agent container**
```bash
# Stack & Stack Clients configuration
STACK_NAME                    # Name of stack to which agent shall be deployed
DATABASE                      # PostGIS/PostgreSQL database name (default: `postgres`)
NAMESPACE                     # Blazegraph namespace (within Stack) to monitor
# Derivation Agent configuration
ONTOAGENT_SERVICE_IRI         # IRI of OntoAgent service
ONTOAGENT_OPERATION_HTTP_URL  # Port needs to match port specified in `docker-compose.yml`
DERIVATION_INSTANCE_BASE_URL  # Base IRI of all instances generated by agent
DERIVATION_PERIODIC_TIMESCALE # Interval in which to check for updated KG information (in s)
REGISTER_AGENT                # Boolean flag whether to register agent in KG (`true` required to detect derivations)
```


### **2) Accessing Github's Container registry**

While building the Docker image of the agent, it also gets pushed to the [Container registry on Github]. **Please note** that this only applies to the stack-deployable images of the agent (i.e. images mentioned in section 1.3) and not the test images. Access needs to be ensured beforehand via your github [personal access token], which must have a `scope` that [allows you to publish and install packages]. To log in to the [Container registry on Github] simply run the following command to establish the connection and provide the access token when prompted:
```
  docker login ghcr.io -u <github_username>
  <github_personal_access_token>
```

### **3) VS Code specifics**

In order to avoid potential launching issues using the provided `launch.json` and `tasks.json` shell commands, please ensure the `augustocdias.tasks-shell-input` plugin is installed.


&nbsp;
## 1.2 Spinning up the core stack

Navigate to `Deploy/stacks/dynamic/stack-manager` and run the following command there from a `bash` terminal. To [spin up the stack], both a `postgis_password` and `geoserver_password` file need to be created in the `stack-manager/inputs/secrets/` directory (see detailed guidance following the provided link). There are several [common stack scripts] provided to manage the stack:

```bash
# Start the stack (please note that this might take some time)
bash ./stack.sh start <STACK NAME>

# Stop the stack
bash ./stack.sh stop <STACK NAME>

# Remove stack services (incl. volumes)
bash ./stack.sh remove <STACK_NAME> -v
```

After spinning up the stack, the GUI endpoints to the running containers can be accessed via Browser (i.e. adminer, blazegraph, ontop, geoserver). The endpoints and required log-in settings can be found in the [Stack Manager] README.


&nbsp;
## 1.3 Deploying the agent to the stack

This agent requires both the [JPS_BASE_LIB] and the [Stack-Clients] to be wrapped by [py4jps]. For testing purposes this needs to be done manually (details see below). Otherwise, this happens automatically when building the Docker images. Simply execute the following command in the same folder as this `README` to build and spin up the *production version* of the agent (from a `bash` terminal). The stack `<STACK NAME>` is the name of an already running stack.

```bash
# Building the agent Docker image and pushing it
bash ./stack.sh build
# Deploying the agent (using pulled image)
bash ./stack.sh start <STACK NAME>
```

The *debug version* will run when built and launched through the provided VS Code `launch.json` configurations:
> **Build and Debug**: Build Debug Docker image (incl. pushing to ghcr.io) and deploy as new container (incl. creation of new `.vscode/port.txt` file)

> **Debug**: Pull Debug Docker image from ghcr.io and deploy as new container (requires deletion of existing `.vscode/port.txt` to ensure mapping to same port)

> **Reattach and Debug**: Simply reattach debugger to running Debug Docker image. In case Debug image needs to be manually started as container, the following command can be used: 
`bash ./stack.sh start <STACK NAME> --debug-port <PORT from .vscode/port.txt>`


&nbsp;
## 1.4 Spinning up the Stack remotely via SSH

To spin up the stack remotely via SSH, VS Code's in-built SSH support can be used. Simply follow the steps provided here to use [VS Code via SSH] to log in to a remote machine (e.g. Virtual machine running on Digital Ocean) an start developing there. Regular log in relies on username and password. To avoid recurring prompts to provide credentials, one can [Create SSH key] and [Upload SSH key] to the remote machine to allow for automatic authentication.

Once logged in, a remote copy of The World Avatar repository can be cloned using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar.git <REPO NAME>
cd <REPO NAME>
git checkout main
git pull
```
Once the repository clone is obtained, please follow these instructions to [spin up the stack] on the remote machine. In order to access the exposed endpoints, e.g. `http://165.232.172.16:3838/blazegraph/ui`, please note that the respective ports might potentially be opened on the remote machine first.

Before starting development of the dockerized agent remotely, all required VSCode extensions shall be installed on the remote machine (e.g. *augustocdias.tasks-shell-input* or the *Python extension*). To prevent and identify potential permission issues on Linux machines (i.e. for executable permission), the following commands can be used to verify and manage permissions:

```bash
# Check permissions
ls -l <REPO NAME>
# Grant permissions
chmod -R +rwx <REPO NAME>
# To prevent git from identifying all files as changed (due to changed permission rights), exclude file permission (chmod) changes from git
git config core.fileMode false
```

&nbsp;
# 2. Using the Agent

The Property Value Estimation Agent is intended to use the `asychronous mode` of the Derivation Framework to detect changes in instantiated [OntoBuiltEnv] properties (i.e. `total floor area`, `transaction records`, `property price index`, and `average price per square metre`) and automatically updates associated `market value` (i.e. `om:AmountOfMoney`) instances in the KG. **Please note**: After initial markup on newly instantiated pure inputs, however, an initial synchronous derivation for new info will be requested to compute the property value estimation on the spot. As the agent adopts the `pyderivationagent`, it also serves HTTP requests to handle synchronous derivations. However, it is (strongly) discouraged to invoke such HTTP request by ONESELF. 

After successful agent start-up, an instructional page shall become available at the root (i.e. `/`) of the port specified in the [docker compose file]. The exact address depends on where the agent container is deployed (i.e. localhost, remote VM, ...), but takes a form like `http://165.232.172.16:5012/`.

## Asynchronous derivation operation
Once the Agent is deployed, it periodically (every month, defined by `DERIVATION_PERIODIC_TIMESCALE`) checks the derivation that `isDerivedUsing` itself (parameter `ONTOAGENT_SERVICE_IRI`) and acts based on the status associated with that derivation. Although the [Derivation Agent] suggests the use of `.env` files to specify environment variables for agent configurations, this approach does not work properly with Docker stacks, i.e. `docker stack deploy`. Hence, the agent configuration is moved into the [docker compose file] instead.

## Prior derivation markup

For the Agent to detect outdated information, a proper mark up of the relevant derivation inputs (i.e. *pure* inputs) is required. (Please note, that another pre-requisite for detecting derivation inputs is the registration of the agent in the KG, i.e. `REGISTER_AGENT=true` in the [docker compose file].) The following methods from the `pyderivationagent` package shall be used to mark up derivation inputs within the KG (for illustration purposes only):
```bash
# Retrieve derivation client from derivation agent
deriv_client = agent.derivation_client
# Alternatively create new derivation client using:
# deriv_client = pyderivationagent.PyDerivationClient(...)

# Using pyderivationagent>=1.3.0, the timestamp for pure inputs will be added automatically when marking up the derivations
# Hence, no need to add them separately (just for reference here)
#deriv_client.addTimeInstance(inputIRI)

# Update time stamp to all pure input instances (i.e. inputIRIs)
deriv_client.updateTimestamp(inputIRI)

# Create (flat!) list of all pure inputs (i.e. inputIRIs)
deriv_inputs = [postcode_IRI, ppi_IRI, tx_IRI1, tx_IRI2, ...]

# Create derivation markup in KG
deriv_iri = deriv_client.createAsyncDerivationForNewInfo(agent.agentIRI, deriv_inputs)
```


&nbsp;
# 3. Agent Integration Test

As this derivation agent modifies the knowledge graph automatically, it is  recommended to run integration tests before deploying it for production. A few integration tests are provided in the `tests` repository. Although the agent is designed to be deployed to a larger Docker stack, the integration tests can both be run as local and as dockerised agent. In both cases Blazegraph and PostgreSQL are spun up as Docker containers using the `testcontainers` library. More specifically, the tests cover to following scenarios:
1) Non-dockerised agent deployed locally with Blazegraph and PostgreSQL spun up as `testcontainers`
2) Agent deployed as Docker container with Blazegraph and PostgreSQL spun up as `testcontainers` from inside that container

All tests are located in the `test_example_agent.py` file while all fixtures and utility functions are provided in the `conftest.py` file:

1. `test_example_agent.py`
   - `test_example_agent.py::test_example_triples`: test if all provided test triples are valid
   - `test_example_agent.py::test_example_data_instantiation`: test proper instantiation of all triples incl. attached time series (for property price index)
   - `test_example_agent.py::test_monitor_derivations`: test if derivation agent performs derivation update as expected
   - `test_example_agent.py::test_wrongly_marked_up_derivations`: test that derivation agent does not perform any derivation update in case of a mismatch between the agent IRI used for agent registration and derivation markup (only works as dockerised test)
2. `conftest.py` file for pytest: all pytest fixtures and other utility functions

&nbsp;
## Pre-requisites:

To run the integration tests, access to the `docker.cmclinnovations.com` registry is required from the machine running the tests (for more information regarding the registry, see the [CMCL Docker registry wiki page]). Furthermore, a few relevant files are provided in the `tests` folder.

1. `test_triples` folder: test triples for derivation inputs
2. `agent_test.env` file: agent configuration parameters used for the **example agent** created during testing
3. `docker-compose-test_dockerised...` files (only relevant for dockerised tests): docker compose file with agent configuration parameters used for agent initialisation when spinning up agent container for tests. **Please note** that provided `environment` variables should match the ones provided in the `agent_test.env` file (**except** for `REGISTER_AGENT` which should be `false`). Otherwise, the example agent registered for testing later will be disconnected from dockerised agent running inside the container.
4. `mockutils` folder: Python modules to mock Docker stack settings (i.e. settings normally retrieved from Stack Clients). When creating the dockerised test agent, those files will be used to overwrite the corresponding modules in `propertyvalueestimation\utils\` repository to ensure successful agent startup. Furthermore, they contain several settings required to run the tests.

&nbsp;
## To perform the agent integration tests locally, please follow these steps:

1. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment for testing. The virtual environment can be created and activated as follows:

    `(Windows)`
    ```bash
    $ python -m venv prop_venv
    $ prop_venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    (prop_venv) $
    ```

    `(Linux)`
    ```bash
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    $ pip3 install virtualenv
    $ python3 -m venv prop_venv
    $ source prop_venv/bin/activate
    (prop_venv) $
    ```
2. Install all required packages in virtual environment (the `-e` flag installs the project for-in place development and could be neglected):
    > **NOTE** The design of separating `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` in this agent is an effort to avoid version collision. The pinned versions of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` are the same versions that passed the integration tests. This file is called in the `Dockerfile` for publishing the production docker image.

    > **NOTE** By design, requirements files and setup script are for different purposes. The former tends to be as specific as possible for reproducibility and production, whereas the latter normally gives a wide range to not limit the choice of packages in development. If you let the pip decide the version of packages, there's a chance it pulls a version of a package that potentially breaks the other packages. For more information, see https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/install-requires-vs-requirements/

    > **NOTE** With that said, if the agent is not intended to be installed with other agents in the same virtual environment it is also valid to pin all the version numbers in the `setup.py` directly and delete the `requirements.txt`.

    `(Windows)`
    ```bash
    (prop_venv) $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    # Install pinned version of required packages, these are tested working version
    (prop_venv) $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Install the rest of required packages for development from setup.py, incl. pytest etc.
    (prop_venv) $ python -m pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

    Please note: If developing/testing in Linux/WSL2, `libpq-dev`, `python-dev`, and `gcc` might be required to build the `psycopg2` package:

    `(Linux)`
    ```bash
    (prop_venv) $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    # Install prerequsisites for building psycopg2
    (prop_venv) $ sudo apt install libpq-dev python3-dev
    # Install pinned version of required packages, these are tested working version
    (prop_venv) $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Install the rest of required packages for development from setup.py, incl. pytest etc.
    (prop_venv) $ python3 -m pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

3. Build latest *StackClient* JAVA resource, copy `.jar` file and entire `lib` folder into `<tmp_stack>` repository, and install resource for py4jps (Please note that this requires [Java Development Kit version >=11]):
    ```bash
    # Build latest Stack_Clients resource for py4jps
    bash ./build_py4jps_stackclients_resource.sh
    # Install Stack_Clients resource for py4jps
    jpsrm install StackClients <tmp_stack> --jar <stack-clients-....jar>
    ```
4. Run integration tests with agent deployed locally (i.e. in memory) and Blazegraph and PostgreSQL spun up as Docker containers (Please note, that respective containers need to be down at the beginning of the tests):
    ```bash
    # Add `-s` flag to see live logs
    pytest -s --docker-compose=docker-compose-testcontainers.yml
   ```
   It has been observed that running the above command might fail due to Docker communication issues. Rerunning it should solve those issues. Tests likely create left over Docker volumes, which might need to be removed manually thereafter.

   To debug the local tests, simply use VS Code's testing panel to start a test in debug mode. The required `docker-compose-testcontainers.yml` shall be executed automatically (specified in `pytest.ini`).

&nbsp;
## To perform the dockerised agent integration tests, please follow these steps:

The dockerised tests use one Docker container to initialise the Derivation agent and run pytest, and use Docker in Docker to spin up the required Blazegraph and Postgres testcontainer instances:

```bash
# Build and run Dockerised agent test
docker compose -f "docker-compose-test_dockerised.yml" up -d --build
```

To run the dockerised tests in Debug mode, both a `docker-compose-test_dockerised_debug.yml` and a suitable `launch.json` configuration have been provided. However, some issues with attaching the Debugger have been observed (i.e. `connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5678 `) using VS Code. Running the debug tests, furthermore, requires all occurrences of `localhost` to be replaced with `host.docker.internal` in the `env_configs_mock.py` and `stack_configs_mock.py` files as well as placing the updated content into the respective files in the `propertyvalueestimation\utils\` repository. This is necessary as the agent codes and tests are mounted as volumes instead of being copied (and adjusted) into the container.
