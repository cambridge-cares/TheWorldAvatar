## Description
This `COP Calculation` agent is designed to calculate the Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the heat pump based on a given temperature with several assumptions, and instantiated in the [The World Avatar] KG according to the [OntoRegionalAnalysis] ontology. Calculation details can be found in the [home page] of this agent. The required data comprimise the temperature data of the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) in the UK which can be calculated and instantiated by the [LSOAInputAgent]. This data is updated annually. 

This agent should be implemented with other agents using Derived Information Framework. This agent works with [LSOAInputAgent](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Agents/LSOAInputAgent), [ResultedConsumptionCalculationAgent](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Agents/ResultedConsumptionCalculationAgent), [UtilityCostCalculationAgent](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Agents/UtilityCostCalculationAgent) and [InequalityIndexCalculationAgent](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Agents/InequalityIndexCalculationAgent), to support the analysis of the impact of heat pumps in the UK (for details refer to  **[Preprint 323](https://como.ceb.cam.ac.uk/preprints/323/)** with **[Preprint 281](https://como.ceb.cam.ac.uk/preprints/281/)**). You may refer to the following graph to find what is the role of this agent in these calculations:

### Basic
The underlying equation of the calculations in this agent is:

$$
COP = \frac{hp\_{efficiency} \times T_H}{T_H - T_C}
$$

**Arguments**:

<u>T<sub>C</sub></u>: The temperature of the cold side of the heat pump

<u>T<sub>H</sub></u>: hot side temperature (see equation above), if not provided, 318.15 will be used as default value.

<u>hp<sub>efficiency</sub></u>: heat pump efficiency (see equation above), if not provided, 0.35 will be used as default value.

**Example input:**
```python
query = {
        'input':{'temperature': 5,
                't_h': 318.15,
                'hp_efficiency': 0.35}
         }
```

**Example output:**
```python
return = {'COP': [2.5]
          }
```

### Use the agent
The COP Calculation Agent is intended to use the `sychronous mode` of the Derivation Framework to detect changes in instantiated [OntoRegionalAnalysis] properties (i.e. `temperature`, `heat pump efficiency`, `hot side temperature`.) and automatically updates associated `COP`  instances in the KG. As the agent adopts the `pyderivationagent`, it serves HTTP requests to handle synchronous derivations.

After successful agent start-up, an instructional page shall become available at the root (i.e. `/`) of the port specified in the [docker compose file]. The exact address depends on where the agent container is deployed (i.e. localhost, remote VM, ...), but takes a form like http://localhost:5150/

The agent is implemented as Docker container to be deployed to a Docker stack spun up by the [Stack Manager]. It is recommended to use `VS Code` to develop/deploy the agent. Hence, a few of the details below are VS Code specific.

This agent uses Derived Infomation Framework, details provided below:

### Agent Setup
Before building and deploying the Docker image, several key properties need to be set in the [Docker compose file] (further details and defaults are provided in the file). For details on the [Derivation Agent configuration] please refer to the official documentation.

```bash
# Stack & Stack Clients configuration
STACK_NAME                    # Name of stack to which agent shall be deployed
DATABASE                      # PostGIS/PostgreSQL database name (default: `postgres`)
NAMESPACE                     # Blazegraph namespace (within Stack) to monitor
# Derivation Agent configuration
ONTOAGENT_SERVICE_IRI         # IRI of OntoAgent service
ONTOAGENT_OPERATION_HTTP_URL  # Port needs to match port specified in `docker-compose.yml`
DERIVATION_INSTANCE_BASE_URL  # Base IRI of all instanced generated by agent
REGISTER_AGENT                # Boolean flag whether to register agent in KG (`true` required to detect derivations)
# --- Assumption spaces --- #
HEATPUMP_EFFICIENCY            # Assume a efficiency of the heat pump
HOTSIDE_TEMPERATURE            # Assume the temperature of the hot side of the heatpump. In the unit of Kelvin 
```

### Accessing Github's Container registry

While building the Docker image of the agent, it also gets pushed to the [Github container registry]. Access needs to be ensured beforehand via your github [personal access token], which must have a `scope` that [allows you to publish and install packages]. To log in to the [Github container registry] simply run the following command to establish the connection and provide the access token when prompted:
```
docker login ghcr.io -u <github_username>
<github_personal_access_token>
```

### VS Code specifics

In order to avoid potential launching issues using the provided `tasks.json` shell commands, please ensure the `augustocdias.tasks-shell-input` plugin is installed.

## Spinning up the stack

Navigate to `Deploy/stacks/dynamic/stack-manager` and run the following command there from a *bash* terminal. To [spin up the stack], both a `postgis_password` and `geoserver_password` file need to be created in the `stack-manager/inputs/secrets/` directory (see detailed guidance following the provided link). There are several [common stack scripts] provided to manage the stack:

```bash
# Start the stack (please note that this might take some time) - the port is optional and defaults to 3838
bash ./stack.sh start <STACK_NAME> <PORT>

# Stop the stack
bash ./stack.sh stop <STACK_NAME>

# Remove stack services (incl. volumes)
bash ./stack.sh remove <STACK_NAME> -v
```

After spinning up the stack, the GUI endpoints to the running containers can be accessed via Browser (i.e. adminer, blazegraph, ontop, geoserver). The endpoints and required log-in settings can be found in the [spin up the stack] readme.

### Deploying the agent to the stack

This agent requires [JPS_BASE_LIB] and [Stack-Clients] to be wrapped by [py4jps]. Therefore, after installation of all required packages (incl. `py4jps >= 1.0.26`), the `StackClients` resource needs to be added to allow for access through `py4jps`. All required steps are detailed in the [py4jps] documentation. However, the commands provided below shall suffice to compile the latest `StackClients` resource locally and install it inside the Docker container using the provided [Dockerfile]. Please note, that compiling requires a [Java Development Kit version >=11]. *Updating the [JPS_BASE_LIB] resource is ONLY required if a pre-release version is needed, which is (currently) not the case for this agent.*

Simply execute the following command in the same folder as this `README` to build the required [Stack-Clients] resource and spin up the *production version* of the agent (from a *bash* terminal). The stack `<STACK NAME>` is the name of an already running stack.
```bash
# Compiling latest StackClient py4jps resource
bash ./build_py4jps_stackclient_resource.sh

# Buildings the agent Docker image and pushing it
bash ./stack.sh build

# Deploying the agent (using pulled image)
bash ./stack.sh start <STACK_NAME>
```

## Upper level instances instatiation
If you started from an empty namespace, or have not instantiate upper level instances such as `country` or `assumption`, the result would not be able to be associated with them. 

Please check if you have created a namespace in the blazegraph, and entered the correct environmental variables in the [agent.env.example](./agent.env.example). 

Afterwards, run the [upper_level_ontology_update.py](./copcalculationagent/upper_level_ontology_update.py), simply run this command in the powershell terminal:
```bash
py ./copcalculationagent/upper_level_ontology_update.py
```

## Prior derivation markup
For the Agent to detect outdated information, a proper mark up of the relevant derivation inputs (i.e. *pure* inputs) is required. (Please note, that another pre-requisite for detecting derivation inputs is the registration of the agent in the KG, i.e. `REGISTER_AGENT=true` in the [docker compose file].) The [markup.py] example from the `pyderivationagent` package shall be used to mark up derivation inputs within the KG (for illustration purposes only), simply run this command in the powershell terminal:
```bash
py ./copcalculationagent/markup.py
```
