 * UsageShareCalculator contains 3 parts that run using SQL query
 * 1) assignUsageShare - For each building_iri, assign Propertyusage_iri,
 * calculate and assign usageShare to each OSM item.
 * 2) updatePropertyUsageStatement - For each building_iri, that has two OSM
 * items, check if they are the same ontoBuilt type,
 * if they are the same ontoBuilt type, return the first instance as the
 * propertyusage_iri
 * 3) updateLandUse - For building_iri which are untagged to any osm_tags, as a
 * default fallback,
 * SQL query is run check and tag buildings with buildings_iri with
 * propertyusage_iri and usageshare according to dlm_landuse.csv
