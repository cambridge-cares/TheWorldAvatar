# SPARQL query for building usage (Semantically correct)
[building_usage_with_OWL.sparql](building_usage_with_OWL.sparql) is currently not used due to performance issue. However, this is the correct approach to query building usage from the KG. This information is stored here for archiving purposes. 

Note: [OntoBuiltEnv.owl](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/blob/80bca4ab84bea190ee67aa606f4cdb154b4c80cf/JPS_Ontology/ontology/ontobuiltenv/OntoBuiltEnv.owl) is required to be uploaded to the same namespace on Blazegraph for the SPARQL to work.
