# Derivation Example

## Purpose
This example demonstrates the usage of the derivation framework (DerivationInputs, DerivationOutputs, DerivationAgent, DerivationClient, and DerivationSparql class) from jps-base-lib.

## Setup
This example uses a docker stack with three containers:

1. derivationexample (containing the following servlets)
    - DerivationExample/InitialiseInstances
    - DerivationExample/InputAgent
    - DerivationExample/MinValueAgent
    - DerivationExample/MaxValueAgent
    - DerivationExample/DifferenceAgent
    - DerivationExample/AverageAgent
2. postgres
3. blazegraph

The example is set up to use the Maven repository at https://maven.pkg.github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/ (in addition to Maven central).
You'll need to provide your credentials in single-word text files in the `credentials` folder
```
  credentials/
      repo_username.txt
      repo_password.txt
      blazegraph_password
      postgres_password
```

`repo_username.txt` should contain your github username, and `repo_password.txt` your github [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token), which must have a 'scope' that [allows you to publish and install packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

`blazegraph_password` and `postgres_password` will set the password for the postgres and blazegraph containers.

Next, you will also need to populate the file `DerivationExample/src/main/resources/credentials.properties` with the passwords you set for your blazegraph and postgres containers, i.e.
```
db.password = [YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD]
kg.password = [YOUR_BLAZEGRAPH_PASSWORD]
```
You should leave the other fields unchanged.

> NOTE: if the `postgres_data` volume was initialised for previous docker containers, it is required to remove it using: `docker volume rm postgres_data`

To build and start the service, you need to spin up the stack using the docker-compose.yml file provided.
In Visual Studio Code, ensure the Docker extension is installed, then right-click docker-compose.yml and select 'Compose Up'.
Alternatively, from the command line, and in the same directory as this README, run

```
docker-compose up -d
```

The default port numbers for the containers are:
| container | port number |
| --- | --- |
| derivationexample | 8081 |
| blazegraph | 8889 |
| postgres | 7432 |

Once the docker stack is up and running, you should be able to access the blazegraph container at (http://localhost:8889/blazegraph). If you are using pgAdmin, you can monitor the postgres container by creating a new server that connects to `localhost` with port number `7432`.

## Test
To test the docker set up, there are integration tests written for this example - `uk.ac.cam.cares.derivation.example.IntegrationTest`. The tests should pass if the stack is up and running with the default port numbers. To run the tests, navigate to the folder containing the java project `DerivationExample`, and run the command `mvn clean test`.

## Logs
By default, logs are written to `/root/.jps/` within the docker container. To copy this file into your local directory, run the following command in the terminal
```
docker cp derivationexample:root/.jps/ .
```

## Initialisation
There are two key demonstrations in this example, the input instance is shared between the two examples. A more visual illustration can be found below:

![Alt text](DerivationExample.svg?raw=true)

Assuming the stack is up and running, the instances can be initialised by running the following command:
```
curl http://localhost:8081/DerivationExample/InitialiseInstances
```
If it is successful, you should receive a HTTP response with the IRIs of the newly created instances, e.g.
```json
{"min value":"http://derivation_example#2b5f97c0-9e90-4eee-8c75-b193a83e2269","derivation of average":"https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontoderivation/derived365dbb1a-89c1-49f4-9e00-546f85feb0c2","input":"http://derivation_example#bdba8ae0-51f5-4447-8d4b-1c4c05f8347f","average":"http://derivation_example#e7966f33-a01d-4ee5-a12e-825a96a10060","derivation of difference":"https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontoderivation/derived9f192ef4-83a7-4c24-b8cf-3f3d9fc7f441","derivation of min value":"https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontoderivation/derived66ccb5a6-6b29-43da-a68c-3e8f3f89010c","difference":"http://derivation_example#01a767ee-d048-4a89-b3e1-6def55f3410d","max value":"http://derivation_example#b8b26247-883d-4243-b19b-d9b08d13cd18","derivation of max value":"https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontoderivation/derived2e8a4d01-bd19-4811-abdb-dee6b21e102a"}
```
If this is not successful, it may be the case that the `derivationexample` container is still loading up, check the console of the container and ensure that the you see a line like this 
```
16-Aug-2021 17:03:05.847 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in [3196] milliseconds
```

## Updating the derivations
The derivations in this example can be updated by running the command:
```
curl http://localhost:8081/DerivationExample/UpdateDerivations
```
On a successful update, you should receive a HTTP response, e.g.:
```json
{"status":"Updated derivation of difference <https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontoderivation/derived2341b3e3-598f-46a1-900d-5506d0906c60> and derivation of average <https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontoderivation/derivedd41b0c5d-b442-4a14-b0a0-14ad99c03ecc>"}
```

## Input
The input is an instance containing a time series. Upon initialisation, the following triples are created in blazegraph:
```
<input> <rdf:type> <http://derived_example#InputData>
<input> <http://www.theworldavatar.com/ontology/ontotimeseries/OntoTimeSeries.owl#hasTimeSeries> <timeseries>
<timeseries> <http://www.theworldavatar.com/ontology/ontotimeseries/OntoTimeSeries.owl#hasRDB> "jdbc:postgresql://postgres/postgres"
<input> <time:hasTime> <timestamp>
<timestamp> <time:inTimePosition> <unixtime>
<unixtime> <time:numericPosition> 123
```
Note that the `timeseries` instance contains data used by the derivations that depend on this input, and `timestamp` is used to check whether the derivation is out-of-date compared to the input.

This input instance is linked to a table in RDB containing a time column and a column with random numbers:
| time | column1 |
| --- | --- |
| 2021-08-11 13:43:24.282104+00 | 123 |
| 2021-08-11 13:43:40.778827+00 | 456 |

This input instance can be updated using an input agent. Each time the agent is called, a random number is added to the table in RDB. In addition, it also updates the unix time stamp of the instance in the triple-store (blazegraph).
```
curl http://localhost:8081/DerivationExample/InputAgent
```
If the update is successful, you should receive a HTTP response, e.g.:
```json
{"status":"Updated <http://derivation_example#bdba8ae0-51f5-4447-8d4b-1c4c05f8347f>"}
```

## Derivation with time series
### Average
This derivation contains averages calculated from the input and stored in a time series table, e.g.
```
<average> <rdf:type> <http://derived_example#Average>
<average> <http://www.theworldavatar.com/ontology/ontotimeseries/OntoTimeSeries.owl#hasTimeSeries> <timeseries>
<timeseries> <http://www.theworldavatar.com/ontology/ontotimeseries/OntoTimeSeries.owl#hasRDB> "jdbc:postgresql://postgres/postgres"
```
| time | column1 |
| --- | --- |
| 2021-08-11 13:43:24.282104+00 | average1 |
| 2021-08-11 13:43:40.778827+00 | average2 |

Derivation of average:
```
<average> <:belongsTo> <derived_average>
<derived_average> <:isDerivedFrom> <input>
<derived_average> <:isDerivedUsing> <AverageAgent>
```
This instance is updated using `AverageAgent`. This agent queries the average value from the input and records the value in the timeseries table.

## Derivations without time series
This example contains 3 derivations: 
1. Maximum value: Maximum value in the input time series table
2. Minimum value: Minimum value in the input time series table
3. Difference: Difference between the minimum and maximum values

### Maximum value
The property instance:
```
<max> <rdf:type> <http://derived_example#MaxValue>
<max> <http://derived_example#hasValue> <valueOfMax> 
<valueOfMax> <http://derived_example#numericalValue> 123
```
The derivation instance:
```
<derivation_of_max> <:isDerivedFrom> <input>
<max> <:belongsTo> <derivation_of_max>
<valueOfMax> <:belongsTo> <derivation_of_max>
<derivation_of_max> <:isDerivedUsing> <MaxValueAgent>
```
The agent for this instance, `MaxValueAgent`, receives HTTP responses in the form of:
```json
{"agent_input": {"http://derivation_example#InputData":[input]}, "belongsTo": {"<max>": "http://derived_example#MaxValue", "<valueOfMax>": "http://derived_example#ScalarValue"}, "derivation": "<derivation_of_max>", "derivation_rdftype": "https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontoderivation/Derivation", "downstream_derivation": {"<max>": ["<derivation_of_diff>"]}}
```
queries the maximum value from the given input using the TimeSeriesClient, and writes a new instance, e.g.
```
<new_max> <rdf:type> <http://derived_example#MaxValue>
<new_max> <http://derived_example#hasValue> <newMaxValue>
<newMaxValue> <http://derived_example#numericalValue> 123
```
And returns a HTTP response in the form of:
```json
{"retrievedInputsAt": timestamp}
```

### Minimum value
This instance is almost identical with the maximum value instance, except that it has the rdf:type `<http://derived_example#MinValue>`. 
The property instance:
```
<min> <rdf:type> <http://derived_example#MinValue>
<min> <http://derived_example#hasValue> <valueOfMin> 
<valueOfMin> <http://derived_example#numericalValue> 123
```
The derivation instance:
```
<derivation_of_min> <:isDerivedFrom> <input>
<min> <:belongsTo> <derivation_of_min>
<valueOfMin> <:belongsTo> <derivation_of_min>
<derivation_of_min> <:isDerivedUsing> <MinValueAgent>
```
The agent for this derivation, `MinValueAgent`, queries the minimum value from the given input using the TimeSeriesClient, and writes a new instance similarly to the `MaxValueAgent`.

### Difference
The difference instance is also identical, except that it has the rdf:type `<http://derived_example#Difference>`.
```
<diff> <rdf:type> <http://derived_example#Difference>
<diff> <http://derived_example#hasValue> <valueOfDiff> 
<valueOfDiff> <http://derived_example#numericalValue> 123
```

The derivation instance contains two inputs - the minimum value and maximum value instances. 
```
<derivation_of_diff> <:isDerivedFrom> <min>
<derivation_of_diff> <:isDerivedFrom> <max>
<diff> <:belongsTo> <derivation_of_diff>
<valueOfDiff> <:belongsTo> <derivation_of_diff>
<derivation_of_diff> <:isDerivedUsing> <DifferenceAgent>
```
The `DifferenceAgent` receives HTTP requests in the form of:
```json
{"agent_input": {"http://derived_example#MaxValue":[max], "http://derived_example#MinValue": [min]}, "belongsTo": {"<diff>": "http://derived_example#Difference", "<valueOfDiff>": "http://derived_example#ScalarValue"}, "derivation": "<derivation_of_diff>", "derivation_rdftype": "https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontoderivation/Derivation", "downstream_derivation": {}}
```
It then queries the values using the given IRIs and calculate the difference between the values. The agent creates a new instance
```
<new_diff> <rdf:type> <http://derived_example#Difference>
<new_diff> <http://derived_example#hasValue> <newDiffValue>
<newDiffValue> <http://derived_example#numericalValue> 123
```
and returns a HTTP response in the form of:
```json
{"retrievedInputsAt": timestamp}
```
