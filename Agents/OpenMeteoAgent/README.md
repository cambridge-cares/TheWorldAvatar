# OpenMeteo agent

## Description

The OpenMeteo agent is intended for instantiating historical weather data retrieved with the Open-Meteo API (https://open-meteo.com/).

The agent will instantiate historical weather data for the weather parameters below, as defined by Open-Meteo, retrieved with the Open-Meteo API. The weather parameters will be instantiated as instances of the Environmental Measurement Station Ontology (OntoEMS) concepts.

| Open-Meteo API Weather Parameter | Corresponding OntoEMS concept |
|:--------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|      ```temperature_2m```        |        AirTemperature         |
|    ```relativehumidity_2m```     |       RelativeHumidity        |
|        ```dewpoint_2m```         |           DewPoint            |
|        ```pressure_msl```        |      AtmosphericPressure      |
|            ```rain```            |           Rainfall            |
|          ```snowfall```          |           Snowfall            |
|         ```cloudcover```         |          CloudCover           |
|  ```direct_normal_irradiance```  |    DirectNormalIrradiance     |
|     ```diffuse_radiation```      |  DiffuseHorizontalIrradiance  |
|       ```windspeed_10m```        |           WindSpeed           |
|     ```winddirection_10m```      |         WindDirection         |

## Build Instructions

### Required credentials
The docker image uses TheWorldAvatar maven repository (https://maven.pkg.github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/). You'll need to provide your credentials (github username/personal access token) in single-word text files located:
```
./credentials/
        repo_username.txt
        repo_password.txt
```

repo_username.txt should contain your github username, and repo_password.txt should contain your github [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token), which must have a 'scope' that [allows you to publish and install packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

The agent requires a PostgreSQL database to save time series data in. The address of the database used is provided as ```db.url``` in
```
./openmeteo_agent/src/main/resource
        config.properties
```

The username and password for the PostgreSQL database need to be provided in
```
./credentials/
        postgres_username.txt
        postgres_password.txt
```

### Building the agent
To build and start the agent, you simply need to spin up a container from the image.

In Visual Studio Code, ensure the Docker extension is installed, then right-click docker-compose.yml and select 'Compose Up'.
Alternatively, from the command line, and in the same directory as this README, run

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Agent Endpoints 

The agent accepts POST requests and is reachable at two endpoints: run endpoint (http://localhost:10101/openmeteo_agent/run), where the agent will instantiate the weather data retrieved with the Open-Meteo API for the user specified coordinate and time; delete endpoint (http://localhost:10101/openmeteo_agent/delete), where the agent will delete the instantiated weather triples at the user specified coordinate.

### 1. Run Endpoint
Available at http://localhost:10101/openmeteo_agent/run

The run endpoint accepts the following POST request parameters:
- ```latitude```: the latitude of the weather station in WGS84
- ```longitude```: the longitude of the weather station in WGS84
- ```start_date```: the start date of the historic weather data wanted in "yyyy-mm-dd" as a string
- ```end_date```: the end date of the historic weather data wanted in "yyyy-mm-dd" as a string

The agent will instantiate a weather station located at (```latitude```, ```longitude```), and the historical weather data reported by the station will be stored as time series. 

The agent will also return the instantiated weather station IRI, e.g. ```{"stationIRI": ["https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontoems/ReportingStation_6f883bc9-e3ba-493e-9db6-f7ce67844442"]}```.

If there is already a weather station located at (```latitude```, ```longitude```), the agent will delete old historical weather data from the weather time series and update the time series with the historical weather data with the specified date in the request.

Example request:
```
{
    "latitude": "52.52",
    "longitude": "-14.41",
    "start_date": "2021-01-02",
    "end_date": "2021-01-03"
}
```

After receiving the above request, the agent will instantiate a weather station located at (52.52, -14.41) with historical weather data, retrieved with Open-Meteo API, from 2021-01-02 to 2021-01-03.

### 2. Delete Endpoint
Available at http://localhost:10101/openmeteo_agent/delete

The delete endpoint accepts the following POST request parameters:
- ```latitude```: the latitude of the weather station in WGS84
- ```longitude```: the longitude of the weather station in WGS84

If there is a weather station instance located at (```latitude```, ```longitude```), the agent will delete the weather station located at (```latitude```, ```longitude```) and its associated triples and time series.

Example request:
```
{
    "latitude": 52.52,
    "longitude": -14.41
}
```

After receiving the above request, the agent will delete the weather station located at (52.52, -14.41) and its associated triples and time series.
