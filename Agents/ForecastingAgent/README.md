# Forecasting Agent

This `Forecasting Agent` can be used to read time series data from The World Avatar (TWA), create a time series forecast, and instantiate the forecast back into the knowledge graph (KG) using the [OntoTimeSeries] ontology. Reading and writing time series from/into the KG relies on the [TimeSeriesClient] and forecasts are created using either pre-trained models or Facebook's [Prophet] (default). 

The Python library [Darts] is used to define, train, and store forecasting models as well as to create the forecasts. It contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to deep neural networks. 

The agent relies on [py4jps] to access the [JPS_BASE_LIB] (incl. the [TimeSeriesClient]) and is implemented as Flask App to respond to HTTP requests.

# 1. Setup

This section specifies the minimum requirements to build and deploy the Docker image. 

&nbsp;
## 1.1 Prerequisites

The dockerised agent can be deployed as standalone version (i.e. outside a larger Docker stack) or deployed to an (existing) stack. Several key environment variables need to be set in the [Docker compose file]:

```bash
# Required environment variables for both Stack and "standalone" (i.e. outside stack) deployment
- STACK_NAME=TEST         # to be left blank for "standalone" deployment
# Additional environment variables required for Stack deployment
# (can be left blank for "standalone" deployment)
- NAMESPACE=test          # Target Blazegraph namespace
- DATABASE=test           # Target PostGIS/PostgreSQL database name
# Additional environment variables required for "standalone deployment"
# (can be left blank for Stack deployment)
- DB_URL=
- DB_USER=
- DB_PASSWORD=
- QUERY_ENDPOINT=
- UPDATE_ENDPOINT=
```

The `STACK_NAME` variable is used to identify the deployment mode of the agent. In case the `STACK_NAME` is left blank, Postgres and Blazegraph endpoint setting will be taken from the docker-compose file. Otherwise they will be retrieved using the StackClients based on the provided `NAMESPACE` and `DATABASE` variables.

**Please note:** A missing `STACK_NAME` variable will result in an error; however, when deploying using the stack-manager start up script, the `STACK_NAME` variable will be set automatically for all services. Hence, this could be left blank here; however, if provided, it needs to match the `STACK_NAME` used by the stack-manager!

&nbsp;
## 1.2 Miscellaneous

**Ensure access to CMCL Docker registry**:
The required `stack-clients-*.jar` resource to be added to py4jps during building the Docker image is retrieved from the Stack-Clients docker image published on `docker.cmclinnovations.com`. Hence, access to the CMCL Docker registry is required from the machine building the agent image. For more information regarding the registry, see the [CMCL Docker registry wiki page].

**Ensure access to Github container registry**:
A `publish_docker_image.sh` convenience script is provided to build and publish the agent image to the [Github container registry]. To publish a new image, your github user name and [personal access token] (which must have a `scope` that [allows you to publish and install packages]) needs to be provided. 

In order to avoid potential launching/debugging issues using the provided `tasks.json` shell commands, please ensure the `augustocdias.tasks-shell-input` plugin is installed.

If you intend to use a forecasting model pre-trained with [Darts]: Please be aware of potential issues when loading the model, in case of version clashes between the current environment and the one used for training.

&nbsp;
# 2. Using the Agent
## 2.1 General workflow


This section describes the workflow and most important steps to access and extent the agent.
The Agent UML diagram provides an overview of how the agent works:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/2f775ad5-4445-4036-8965-0021df53f6d9/image.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
</p>

The `Forecasting Agent` forecasts an existing time series in an KG using its `iri`. After verifying the received HTTP request, the agent loads a model configuration from the [mapping file]. This is either the `DEFAULT` one (which will use [Prophet]) or else must be specified with the `use_model_configuration` parameter in the HTTP request to use a pre-trained model other than Prophet. The [mapping File ] describes in detail what a model configuration `dict` consists of. 

Next the agent loads the time series (+ `covariates` if `load_covariates_func` is given in the loaded configuration) with the TSClient. 

Then, it loads the model. This is either a pre-trained model specified in the model configuration with the model link `model_path_pth_link` and the checkpoint link `model_path_ckpt_link` or else a new Prophet model is fitted to predict the data. The forecast starts from the optional parameter `forecast start date` in the request or if not specifed the last available date is taken. The forecast lasts over the number of specified time steps (`horizon`).

Finally the forecasted time series is instantiated. For that purpose a new `forecast iri` is created and attached to the `iri` specified in the request. Further metadata, e.g. which data and models are used, are included as well using the [OntoTimeSeries] ontology.

&nbsp;
## 2.2 Build and Deploy the Agent

To build and publish the agent Docker image please use the following commands. Please note that all of those commands are bundled in the  `publish_docker_image.sh` convenience script.

```bash
# Building the Docker image (production / debug)
docker-compose -f <docker-compose file>  build

# Publish the Docker image to the Github container registry
docker image push ghcr.io/cambridge-cares/<image tag>:<version>
```

Time out issues have been observed when building the image. If this happens, please try pulling the required stack-clients image first by `docker pull docker.cmclinnovations.com/stack-client:1.6.2`.

###  **Docker Deployment**

Deploy the dockerised agent by running the following code in the command prompt from the same location where this README is located (ideally, use a bash terminal to avoid potential issues with inconsistent path separators). 

```bash
# Deploy the Docker images (locally)
docker-compose -f <docker-compose file> up
```

To verify the correct startup of the agent, open the URL address the agent is running on, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser. 

### **Stack Deployment**

If you want to spin up this agent as part of a stack, do the following:
1) Build the (production) image using the commands provided above (do not spin up the image)
2) Copy the `forecasting-agent.json` file from the [stack-manager-input-config] folder into the `inputs/config` folder of the stack manager, adjusting the absolute path of the bind mount as required.
3) Start the stack manager as usual (i.e. `bash ./stack.sh start <STACK_NAME>`). This should start the container. Please use a bash terminal to avoid potential issues with inconsistent path separators.


&nbsp;
## 2.3 Forecasting time series via HTTP requests

Forecasting a time series is triggered by received HTTP requests. An example request to forecast an `iri` is provided in [HTTP_Request_forecast]: 

### Input parameters
- **iri**: the `iri` of the instance which has a time series attached to it. This iri will receive the `hasForecastedValue` relationship.
- **horizon**: the number of time steps the agent forecasts autorecursively into the future.
- **forecast_start_date**: the start `dateTime` of the forecast. If not specified, simply the last value is taken as a starting point. The series is split at this point and future available data is used to calculate the forecasting error.
- **data_length**: the number of values loaded before `forecast_start_date`. This data is used directly as input to fit [Prophet] or to scale the input for the pre-trained neural network. (If not set the default value from the [mapping file] is used)
- **use_model_configuration**: if specified this model configuration from the [mapping file] is used.  


## 2.4 Custom model configurations and new models
Specify your custom configurations following the example of the `TFT_HEAT_SUPPLY` model configuration in the [mapping file]. 

If you need covariates, define a function which load them (similarly to `get_covs_heat_supply`) for the `load_covariates_func` parameter in your configuration. To use your own pre-trained model with [Darts], expand the [agent module] where `load_pretrained_model` is called just like the model for `TFT_HEAT_SUPPLY` is loaded. You can use the function `load_pretrained_model` as well if thats suits your model, just specify your model class and set the `input_length` as for `TFT_HEAT_SUPPLY`. 

&nbsp;
# 3. How to run tests

Both unit tests and dockerised integration tests are provided. Testcontainers based on the [docker-compose.test.yml] file are used to spin up a stack with a Blazegraph and a PostgreSQL container for the integration tests. No volumes are used as data is only used for testing.

**Setting up the testing environment**

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment for testing, which can be created via
`(Windows)`
```cmd
$ python -m venv forecasting_venv
$ forecasting_venv\Scripts\activate.bat
(forecasting_venv) $
```

Install the `forecasting` project including all packages required for testing as listed in `setup.py` via
`(Windows)`
```
(forecasting_venv) $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip  
(forecasting_venv) $ python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

**Running tests**

You can start all tests by running the following command in your console:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest --docker-compose=docker-compose.test.yml
# Run all tests with verbose output (i.e. logging output)
pytest -s --docker-compose=docker-compose.test.yml
```


```diff
- Note: Currently the agent holds several (helper) scripts tailored towards house 45 (inside the resources folder). They are mainly here for reference and shall be removed in a later revision of the agent.
```
