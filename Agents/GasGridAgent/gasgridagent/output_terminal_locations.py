"""
    This script queries the locations of all Gas Terminals within the KG and writes the results
	to a local GeoJSON file. When deployed as part of the Gas Grid Agent, cron will run this
	script once per day, the website visualisation will then use wget to download it. This ensures
	that if any new Terminals are added to the KG, the visualisation can plot them without
	any manual changes needed.

    Local deployment requires:
        - The gasgridagent.properties file to be set correctly.
        - Triple store endpoint to contain Gas Terminals in expected format.

    Authors:
		- trs53<@>cam.ac.uk
		- mdhillman<@>cmclinnovations.com

	Future improvements:
		- If this script fails (KG endpoint inaccessible, KG response is wrong format, local 
		  memory issues etc.), it should use the EmailSender class to notify developers of the
		   issue. This will require some setup (perhaps in the Python Wrapper).
