# GFAAgent
## 1. Description
This agent has been developed to compute the Gross Floor Area (GFA) and GFA cost of buildings. Presently, the agent performs the following two tasks:
1) Calculate the Gross Floor Area of buildings through multiplying the area of the building footprint with the number of storeys
2) Calculate the GFA cost of buildings by GFA and standard unit price of GFA cost.

### 1.1 Requirements
1) The agent requires 3D building models based on the CityGML standard. These models must be uploaded through the [stack-data-uploader](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Deploy/stacks/dynamic/stack-data-uploader#citydb-data).
2) The agent requires number of floors data. Therefore, the Building Floor Agent should be run firstly.
3) GFA cost standard unit price: The latest standard GFA cost should be integrated in csv file named as [ais_cost.csv](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/blob/4a5b2b6eaf60be88f95e1561da24b043943fec83/Agents/GFAAgent/stack-data-uploader-input-config/ais_cost.csv), which need to upload to postgresql by stack-data-uploader first.
4) Building usage matching: The mathcing of building cost standard and OntobBuiltEnv, which stores in the [cost_ontobuiltenv.csv](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/blob/4a5b2b6eaf60be88f95e1561da24b043943fec83/Agents/GFAAgent/src/main/resources/cost_ontobuiltenv.csv).

## 2. GFA Agent
The agent is designed for execution through a Docker container. Other deployment workflows are beyond the scope of this document. Follow the steps below to build and deploy the agent.
### 2.1 Preparation
This agent is set up to use this [Maven repository](https://maven.pkg.github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/) (in addition to Maven central).
You'll need to provide your credentials in a single-word text files located like this:
```
./credentials/
    repo_username.txt
    repo_password.txt
```

repo_username.txt should contain your Github username. repo_password.txt should contain your Github [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token),
which must have a 'scope' that [allows you to publish and install packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

### 2.2 Retrieving GFAAgent's image
The GFAagent should be pulled automatically with the stack-manager, if not you can pull the latest version from [cambridge_cares package](https://github.com/orgs/cambridge-cares/packages/container/package/gfaagent) using `docker pull ghcr.io/cambridge-cares/gfaagent:<LATEST-VERSION>`

### 2.3 Starting with the stack-manager
The agent has been implemented to work in the stack. To do so, place gfaagent.json in the [stack-manager config directory]. 

Then, run `./stack.sh start <STACK NAME>` in the [stack-manager] main folder. This will spin up the agent in the stack.

### 2.4 Data prerequisites
GFA calculations:
1) Make sure number of floors of each building can be queried via
```
PREFIX env: <https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontobuiltenv/>
SELECT ?building ?floor
WHERE {?building env:hasNumberOfFloors/env:hasValue ?floor .}
```
this is added by running the BuildingFloorAgent.

2) Building geometries in citydb queried via [total_area_query.sql].

Cost calculations:
1) Requires OSM usage information added by OSMAgent, query via [building.sparql].


### 2.5 Running the Agent
The agent is reachable at two endpoints:
1) `/gfa`: calculate GFA of buildings
2) `/cost`: calculate cost of buildings

To run the agent, run the following cURL command:
```
curl -X POST localhost:3838/gfaagent/gfa
curl -X POST localhost:3838/gfaagent/cost
```
[total_area_query.sql]: ./src/main/resources/total_area_query.sql
[building.sparql]: ./src/main/resources/building.sparql
