# This file contains triples to instantiate Static Point Source instances
# required for the Aermod Agent to retrieve emission rates with their 
# respective locations
# ([prefix] will be replace with actual KB prefix within agent logic)
#
# TODO: <IRI to be replaced manually> needs to be replaced with the actual
#       instantiated CityObjectIRI representing the outlet for the corresponding
#       emission before starting the agent; this needs to be done manually
#       as there is (currently) no way to identify these instances programmatically
