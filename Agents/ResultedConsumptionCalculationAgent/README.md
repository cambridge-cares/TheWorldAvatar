## Description
This `COP Calculation` agent is designed to calculate the Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the heat pump based on a given temperature with several assumptions, and instantiated in the [The World Avatar] KG according to the [OntoRegionalAnalysis] ontology. Details can be found in the [home page] of this agent. The required data comprimise the temperature data of the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) in the UK which can be calculated and instantiated by the [LSOAInputAgent]. This data is updated annually. 

The agent is implemented as Docker container to be deployed to a Docker stack spun up by the [Stack Manager]. It is recommended to use `VS Code` to develop/deploy the agent. Hence, a few of the details below are VS Code specific.

This agent uses Derived Infomation Framework, details provided below:

### Agent Setup
Before building and deploying the Docker image, several key properties need to be set in the [Docker compose file] (further details and defaults are provided in the file). For details on the [Derivation Agent configuration] please refer to the official documentation.

```bash
# Stack & Stack Clients configuration
STACK_NAME                    # Name of stack to which agent shall be deployed
DATABASE                      # PostGIS/PostgreSQL database name (default: `postgres`)
NAMESPACE                     # Blazegraph namespace (within Stack) to monitor
# Derivation Agent configuration
ONTOAGENT_SERVICE_IRI         # IRI of OntoAgent service
ONTOAGENT_OPERATION_HTTP_URL  # Port needs to match port specified in `docker-compose.yml`
DERIVATION_INSTANCE_BASE_URL  # Base IRI of all instanced generated by agent
REGISTER_AGENT                # Boolean flag whether to register agent in KG (`true` required to detect derivations)
# --- Assumption spaces --- #
HEATPUMP_EFFICIENCY            # Assume a efficiency of the heat pump
HOTSIDE_TEMPERATURE            # Assume the temperature of the hot side of the heatpump. In the unit of Kelvin 
```


### How to deploy this agent on stack
Details about the routes on the stack establishment, and how to deploy the agent on the stack can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/blob/dev-heat-pump-migration-to-stack-2/Agents/LSOAInputAgent/deploy_agent_on_stack.html)
### Use the agent
The COP Calculation Agent is intended to use the `sychronous mode` of the Derivation Framework to detect changes in instantiated [OntoRegionalAnalysis] properties (i.e. `temperature`, `heat pump efficiency`, `hot side temperature`.) and automatically updates associated `COP`  instances in the KG. As the agent adopts the `pyderivationagent`, it serves HTTP requests to handle synchronous derivations.

After successful agent start-up, an instructional page shall become available at the root (i.e. `/`) of the port specified in the [docker compose file]. The exact address depends on where the agent container is deployed (i.e. localhost, remote VM, ...), but takes a form like http://localhost:5150/

Details about how to use the agent please see the [home page] of this agent
## Prior derivation markup

For the Agent to detect outdated information, a proper mark up of the relevant derivation inputs (i.e. *pure* inputs) is required. (Please note, that another pre-requisite for detecting derivation inputs is the registration of the agent in the KG, i.e. `REGISTER_AGENT=true` in the [docker compose file].) The [markup.py] example from the `pyderivationagent` package shall be used to mark up derivation inputs within the KG (for illustration purposes only)
