# RFID Update Agent

This agent is for maintaining data and the corresponding instances in the knowledge graph (KG) regarding RFID tag data being sent to a RFID servlet.
It's only purpose is to retrieve new data (if available) from the API and download it into 
the corresponding database, as well as, instantiating KG instances and connection when called for the first time. The 
agent uses the [time-series client](https://github.com/TheWorldAvatar/baselib/tree/main/src/main/java/uk/ac/cam/cares/jps/base/timeseries)
from the JPS base lib to interact with both the KG and database.

Before explaining the usage of the agent, we will briefly summarize the RFID API that is contacted by one of the classes in this package to retrieve data.

## RFID API

The API will be briefly described here. 

### Prerequisite
To use the API, a RFID servlet must be already set up and running. 

### Data retrieval
Data can be retrieved via a GET request. 

#### The endpoint
The endpoint for retrieval of historical data has the following structure:
```
http(s)://host:port/rfid-servlet/values=status/limit=<how many number of readings>/keys=<tag ID number>
``` 

#### Example readings
Readings are returned in the response body in form of a JSON Object which consist of key-value pairs. The values are in the form of JSON Arrays 
which contains multiple JSON Objects. Each JSON Objects consist of two key-value pairs with the keys being "ts" and "value" respectively.

The following shows a single JSON object for historical time-series data for multiple keys:
```
{"tag_00000000000000A000009726_status":[{"value":"Out","ts":1655966558492},{"value":"In","ts":1655964909815},{"value":"Out","ts":1655718804322}],
 "tag_00000000000000A000009727_status":[{"value":"In","ts":1655718784802},{"value":"Out","ts":1655718780343},{"value":"In","ts":1655718777121}]}
```
## Usage 
This part of the README describes the usage of the input agent. The module itself can be packaged into an executable war, deployed as a web servlet on tomcat. 
Sending the appropriate request to the correct URL will initiate the agent. Since it uses the time-series client which maintains both instances in a 
knowledge graph and a Postgres database to store the data, these will be required to be set-up before.  

The [next section](#requirements) will explain the requirements to run the agent.

### Requirements
It is required to have access to a knowledge graph SPARQL endpoint and Postgres database. These can run on the same machine 
or need to be accessible from the host machine via a fixed URL.

This can be either in form of a Docker container or natively running on a machine. It is not in the scope of this README
to explain the set-up of a knowledge graph triple store or Postgres database.

### Property files
For running the agent, four property files are required:
- One [property file for the agent](#agent-properties) itself pointing to the mapping configuration.
- One [property file for the time-series client](#time-series-client-properties) defining how to access the database and SPARQL endpoint.
- One [property file for the RFID API](#api-properties) defining the variable, limit, path URL and keys.
- One [property file for the agent launcher](#launcher-properties) defining the order in which timeseries data is updated for each key.

#### Agent properties
The agent property file only needs to contain a single line:
```
rfid.mappingfolder=RFIDUPDATE_AGENT_MAPPINGS
```
where `RFIDUPDATE_AGENT_MAPPINGS` is the environment variable pointing to the location of a folder containing JSON key to IRI mappings. 
An example property file can be found in the `config` folder under `agent.properties`. See [this section](#mapping-files) of the README for an 
explanation of the mapping files.

#### Time-series client properties
The time-series client property file needs to contain all credentials and endpoints to access the SPARQL endpoint of
the knowledge graph and the Postgres database. It should contain the following keys:
- `db.url` the [JDBC URL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/jdbc-use.html) for the Postgres database
- `db.user` the username to access the Postgres database
- `db.password` the password to access the Postgres database
- `sparql.query.endpoint` the SPARQL endpoint to query the knowledge graph
- `sparql.update.endpoint` the SPARQL endpoint to update the knowledge graph

More information can be found in the example property file `client.properties` in the `config` folder.

#### API properties
The API properties contains the necessary information for the RFID API (see the [API description](#rfid-api)),
the port number and keys. It should contain the following keys:
- `variable` the value to retrieved from the API.
- `limit` the number of historical readings to retrieve from the API.
- `path.url` the URL for where the RFID servlet is located, the default should be http://localhost:1016/rfid-agent. 
- `keys` the keys that represents the RFID tag numbers.
More information can be found in the example property file `api.properties` in the `config` folder.

#### launcher properties
The launcher properties contains the keys that decide the order in which timeseries data is updated for each key.
It should contain the following keys:
- `keys` the keys that represents the RFID tag numbers. Its format should be similar to this: tag_tag ID number_status. 
More information can be found in the example property file `launcher.properties` in the `config` folder.

#### Mapping files
What are the mapping files and why are they required? The mapping files define how data received from the API is connected
to the knowledge graph (KG). Specifically, each JSON key in the readings represents a specific measure that needs to be 
represented by an IRI, if it should be saved in the database.

Furthermore, measures can be grouped into one time-series (will result in one time-series instance per group in the KG).
This should be done so that all measures in one group are recorded at the same time interval, and so they come from 
the same readings. However, it is possible to break down the readings into smaller, logical groups.

The mapping is achieved in this package by using one property file per group. Each property file contains one line per 
JSON key that should be linked to an IRI, e.g. like:
```
co_slope=http:/example/co_slope
```
If the IRI is left empty (`co_slope=` in the example), i.e. because there is no instance that represents the measure yet, 
it will be automatically created when the agent is run for the first time. This automatically generated URI will have the
following form:
```
[prefix]/[key]_[UUID]
```
where the `[prefix]` is hardcoded into the `RFIDUpdateAgent` class in a public, static field called `generatedIRIPrefix`
which is based on the time-series client namespace, `[key]` is the JSON key the URI is generated for, and `[UUID]` is a 
randomly generated UUID.

Note, that not all JSON keys need to be represented in the mapping files (the data will simply be ignored and not stored), 
but there needs to be a 1-1 mapping, i.e. no IRI can be used for multiple JSON keys.

To ensure that the same IRIs are used for each JSON key, the mapping files are saved back after each run (only really 
necessary when some of them are automatically generated). Note, that if you change any mapping in preceding runs, they 
will be seen as new time-series, which can result in inconsistencies in both the KG and database.

Examples for the structure of the mapping folder and file can be found in the `mapping` folder within the `config` 
folder. 

### Building the RFID Update Agent
The RFID Update Agent is set up to use the Maven repository at https://maven.pkg.github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/ (in addition to Maven central).
You'll need to provide  your credentials in single-word text files located like this:
```
./credentials/
    repo_username.txt
    repo_password.txt
```

repo_username.txt should contain your github username, and repo_password.txt your github [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token),
which must have a 'scope' that [allows you to publish and install packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

Modify `api.properties` and `client.properties` in the `config` folder accordingly. You should not modify the `agent.properties` file as the Dockerfile will set the environment variable 
RFIDUPDATE_AGENT_MAPPINGS to point towards the location of the mapping folder. The Dockerfile will copy all 4 properties files and mapping folder and set environment variables pointing 
to their location thus you do not need to shift the properties files and mapping folder nor add in environment variables manually.

To build and start the agent, open up the command prompt in the same directory as this README, run
```
docker-compose up -d
```

The agent is reachable at "rfid-update-agent/retrieve" on localhost port 1017.


#### Run the agent
To run the agent, a POST request must be sent to http://localhost:1017/rfid-update-agent/retrieve with a correct JSON Object.
Follow the request shown below.

```
POST http://localhost:1017/rfid-update-agent/retrieve
Content-Type: application/json
{"agentProperties":"RFIDUPDATE_AGENTPROPERTIES","apiProperties":"RFIDUPDATE_APIPROPERTIES","clientProperties":"RFIDUPDATE_CLIENTPROPERTIES", "launcherProperties":"RFIDUPDATE_LAUNCHERPROPERTIES"}}
```

If the agent run successfully, you should see a JSON Object returned back that is similar to the one shown below.
```
{"Result":["Input agent object initialized.","Time series client object initialized.","API connector object initialized.","Retrieved 2 RFID readings.","Data updated with new readings from API.",
 "Data updated with new readings from API.","Timeseries Data has been updated."]}
```

If the JSON Object returned back is as shown below, it means that the request was written wrongly. Check whether the URL, keys and values are written correctly.
```
{"Result":"Request parameters are not defined correctly."}
```
