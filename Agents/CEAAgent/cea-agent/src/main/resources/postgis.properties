#--PostGIS properties--#
# Need to be changed based on the setup of the system:
#  172.17.0.1 is the default host IP seen from the container and can be used to access services running on the host (Linux).
#  On Docker for Mac or Windows host.docker.internal should work instead.
# URL to connect to PostGIS database //change localhost to host.docker.internal on docker
# Claudius PostGIS database:
db.url=
# Username and password will be read from the credentials when creating the image. Do not change!
# Username to connect to PostGIS database //add to credentials on docker USERNAME
db.user=USERNAME
# Password to connect to PostGIS database //add to credentials on docker PASSWORD
db.password=PASSWORD
# Default table to query terrain data from
db.table=
