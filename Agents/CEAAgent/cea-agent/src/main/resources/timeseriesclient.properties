#  On Docker for Mac or Windows host.docker.internal should work instead.
# URL to connect to PostgreSQL database //change localhost to host.docker.internal on docker
# db.url=jdbc:postgresql://host.docker.internal:5432/timeseries
# Claudius postgres database:
db.url=jdbc:postgresql://192.168.137.1:5433/CEAagent

# Username to connect to PostgreSQL database //add to credentials on docker USERNAME
db.user=USERNAME
# Password to connect to PostgreSQL database //add to credentials on docker PASSWORD
db.password=PASSWORD
