# Heat Emission Agent
 This agent is to return the heat emission information of different buildings/objects presented in a given area. Therefore, the heat emission data can be automatically assigned to corresponding buildings within a specific area. This is of interest to the Cooling Singapore 2.0 Project. 
 
 It demonstrates firstly the feasibility of a cross-domain query and secondly the evaluation of the heat emission data in terms of emission values and respective coordinates within a bounding box in Jurong Island. To achieve this, it consists of four parts. First, we obtain all the chemical plants, plant items, IRIs and CO2 emission via query in "jibusinessunits"; Second, for a particular chemical plant, its fuel CEI and thermal efficiency are queried; subsequently, all the heat emission coordinates are evaluated via query in "jriEPSG24500"; finally, the heat emission values are calculated with CO2 emission, CEI and efficiency and assigned to the emission coordinates, after a filter based on a boundary area specified.The heat emission data are saved into the TheWorldAvatar blazegraph.

# Example Heat Emission Data
Heat Emission Data is returned to the response body in form of a JSON Object which consist of key-value pair. The JSONObject has the 
key:"result", which contains a JSONArray containing JSONObjects. Each of these individual JSONObjects found within the JSONArray
provide the heat emission coordinates and the corresponding heat emission value in the unit of MW.

# Usage 
This part of the README describes the usage of the input agent. The agent itself can be packaged into an executable war, deployed as a web servlet on tomcat. Sending the appropriate request to the correct URL will initiate the agent. 

The next section explains the requirements to run the agent.

# Requirements
It is required to have access to a knowledge graph SPARQL endpoint. These can run on the same machine or need to be accessible from the host machine via a fixed URL.

This can be either in form of a Docker container or natively running on a machine. It is not in the scope of this README to explain the set-up of a knowledge graph triple store

# Building the HeatEmission Agent

The HeatEmission Agent is set up to use the Maven repository at https://maven.pkg.github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/ (in addition to Maven central). You'll need to provide your credentials in single-word text files located like this:

./credentials/
    repo_username.txt
    repo_password.txt

repo_username.txt should contain your github username, and repo_password.txt your github [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token),
which must have a 'scope' that [allows you to publish and install packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

To build and start the agent, open up the command prompt in the same directory as this README, run

`docker-compose up -d`


The agent is reachable at "heatemissionagent/performheatquery" on localhost port 8084.

# Run the agent
To run the agent, a POST request must be sent to http://localhost:8084/heatemissionagent/performheatquery with a correct JSON Object.
From a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) terminal, execute the request shown below.

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"job":{"lower_bounds":"8464#23588#0","upper_bounds":"17619#30520#105"}}' http://localhost:8084/heatemissionagent/performheatquery`



If the agent runs successfully, you should see a returned JSON Object that is similar to the one shown below.

`{"result":[{"Coordinate":"13469.086796413478#26462.33106185692#41.0","Heat Emission":80.22970472647032},{"Coordinate":"13252.157092925416#28023.664545558153#25.0","Heat Emission":80.22970472647032},{"Coordinate":"13341.125256486484#26898.004451070658#21.0","Heat Emission":80.22970472647032}]}
`

If there is a returned message as shown below, it means that the input JSON object is written wrongly. Check whether the values and formats are written correctly.

`"Error in input parameters, please check the input file"`
