# Sewage Network Agent
This agent is for maintaining data and the corresponding instances in the knowledge graph (KG) regarding the sewage network located in a midsize town in Germany. Its purpose is to instantiate the sewage network. 

## Usage 
The module itself can be packaged into an executable war, deployed as a web servlet on tomcat. Sending the appropriate request to the correct URL will initiate the agent. 

### Requirements
- It is required to have access to a knowledge graph SPARQL endpoint. This can be either in form of a Docker container or natively running on a machine. It is not in the scope of this README to explain the set-up of a knowledge graph triple store. 
- The required input data files need to be preprocessed before running this agent. A dockerised Python code is available in the Preprocessing folder to generate all the required CSV files. Please consult the readme file in that folder on how to do this. Please refer to the environment variables section in the Dockerfile for the exact list of CSV files. Running the preprocessing code will automatically put the files in the correct place.
- This agent requires a running instance of the Access Agent. Once this has been spun up, appropriate routing information needs to be uploaded, mapping the `sewagenetwork` label (or equivalent) to the query and update endpoints of the relevant blazegraph namespace (examples see below). Please consult the Access Agent documentation on how to do this.

#### Routing setup for local Blazegraph
The query endpoint and update endpoint for routing information has to be set as, e.g.
```
http://blazegraph-access-agent:8080/blazegraph/namespace/ontosewage/sparql
```
If running within a stack, use e.g.
```
http://<STACK NAME>-blazegraph:8080/blazegraph/namespace/sewagenetwork/sparql
```

#### Building the agent

The agent is set up to use the Maven repository. Credentials in single-word text files located like this are required:
```
./credentials/
    repo_username.txt
    repo_password.txt
```
repo_username.txt should contain your github username, and repo_password.txt your github [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token),
which must have a 'scope' that [allows you to publish and install packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

To build and start the agent, open up the command prompt in the same directory as this README, run
```
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Stack Deployment

If you want to spin up this agent as part of a stack, instead of `docker-compose up -d`, do the following:
- Build the image via `docker-compose build`. Do not start the container.
- Copy the `json` file from the `stack-manager-input-config` folder into the `inputs/config` folder of the stack manager.
- Start the stack manager as usual. This should start the container.

#### Run the agent
To run the agent, a POST request must be sent to http://localhost:1080/sewage-network-agent/performsewageupdate with a JSON Object. In this agent, it contains the URL for the SPARQL endpoint. You must make sure that the namespace appearing in this URL exists before sending the request. Follow the sample request shown below.
```

POST http://localhost:1080/sewage-network-agent/performsewageupdate
Content-Type: application/json
{"endpoint":"http://host.docker.internal:48888/ontosewage"}
```

In curl syntax:
```
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{
\"endpoint\":\"http://host.docker.internal:48888/ontosewage\"}"  http://localhost:1080/sewage-network-agent/performsewageupdate
```

If running the agent within a stack:
```
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"endpoint\":\"http://<STACK NAME>-access-agent:8080/sewagenetwork\"}"  http://localhost:3838/sewage-network-agent/performsewageupdate
```

If the agent runs successfully, you should see a returned JSON Object that is similar to the one shown below.
```
{"Result":"Data has been instantiated."}
```
