# District Heating Emission Estimation Agent

This `Emission Agent` converts `ConsumedGasAmount`s and `ProvidedHeatAmount`s (as instantiated by the District Heating Optimisation Agent according to [OntoHeatNetwork]) into associated `Emission` instances according to [OntoDispersion]. The estimation and instantiation of associated emissions is required to simulate emission dispersion using Aermod later; however, the assessment of emissions is 1) currently limited to NO<sub>x</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> , and PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 2) solely based on emission factors found in the literature instead of a detailed combustion model.

The agent is implemented using the [Derived Information Framework] to ensure proper data provenance. The required input instances to derive emissions are described in the [required derivation markup](#13-required-derivation-markup) section below. The agent is designed to be deployed as a Docker container and can be deployed either as standalone version or as part of a larger Docker stack.

&nbsp;
# 1. Setup

This section specifies the minimum requirements to build and deploy the Docker image. 

## 1.1 Agent Settings

The dockerised agent can be deployed as "standalone" version (i.e., outside a larger Docker stack) or deployed to an (existing) stack. Several key environment variables need to be set in the
- [docker compose file] for "standalone" deployment
- [stack manager input config file] for deployment using the [Stack manager]

```bash
#--- Deployment specific parameters ---#
# Required for Stack deployment (can be left blank for "standalone" deployment)
STACK_NAME                    # Will be set automatically when deployed via stack-manager
NAMESPACE                     # Blazegraph namespace (within Stack) to monitor
DATABASE                      # PostGIS/PostgreSQL database name (default: `postgres`)
# Required for "standalone" deployment (can be left blank for Stack deployment)
STACK_NAME                    # to be left blank for "standalone" deployment
DB_URL                        # PostGIS/PostgreSQL URL
DB_USER                       # PostGIS/PostgreSQL username
DB_PASSWORD                   # PostGIS/PostgreSQL password

#--- Derivation Agent parameters ---#
SPARQL_QUERY_ENDPOINT         # SPARQL endpoint to monitor/update
SPARQL_UPDATE_ENDPOINT        # SPARQL endpoint to monitor/update
ONTOAGENT_SERVICE_IRI         # IRI of OntoAgent service
ONTOAGENT_OPERATION_HTTP_URL  # Port needs to match port specified in `docker-compose.yml`
DERIVATION_INSTANCE_BASE_URL  # Base IRI of all instanced generated by agent
DERIVATION_PERIODIC_TIMESCALE # Interval in which to check for updated KG information (in s)
                              # (irrelevant as Forecasting Agent uses synchronous derivations only)
REGISTER_AGENT                # Boolean flag whether to register agent in KG (`true` required to detect derivations)
# Required inputs for DerivationAgent to start, although not relevant for ForecastingAgent (i.e., shall be left blank)
KG_USERNAME
KG_PASSWORD
FILE_SERVER_ENDPOINT
FILE_SERVER_USERNAME
FILE_SERVER_PASSWORD
```

## 1.2 Miscellaneous

**Only relevant** if you intend to build (and publish) the Docker image: Ensure access to Github container registry as:
- The required `stack-clients-*.jar` resource to be added to [py4jps] during building the Docker image is retrieved from the published Stack-Clients docker image
- A `publish_docker_image.sh` convenience script is provided to build and publish the agent image to the [Github container registry]. To publish a new image, your github user name and [personal access token] (which must have a `scope` that [allows you to publish and install packages]) needs to be provided. 


## 1.3 Required Derivation Markup

Before any emissions can be estimated (and instantiated), all required inputs need to be properly instantiated. This includes:
- 1 `dh:ProvidedHeatAmount` or 1 or more `dh:ConsumedGasAmount`s: instances associated with (optimised) time series for consumed gas and externally sourced heat amounts; either exactly one `dh:ProvidedHeatAmount` or at least one `dh:ConsumedGasAmount` instance is required to evaluate emissions
- 1 `disp:SimulationTime`: the time stamp for which to estimate the emissions, i.e., for which later also to simulate the emission dispersion; please note that this time stamp needs to be within the time series of the `dh:ProvidedHeatAmount` or `dh:ConsumedGasAmount`
- 1 `disp:StaticPointSource`: the instance describing the location which `disp:emits` the estimated emissions; please note that this instance needs to have a `disp:hasOntoCityGMLCityObject` relationship attached for the `Aermod Agent` to work later

The [example triples] used for the integration tests provide an example of the expected instantiation structure, and also reference the used namespace prefixes.


&nbsp;
# 2. Agent Logic

The estimation logic is rather rudimentary, but sufficient to demonstrate the overall approach to link the district heating optimisation with dispersion modelling:

1) Extract time series for marked up `dh:ProvidedHeatAmount` or `dh:ConsumedGasAmount`(s) from KG
2) Summarise `dh:ConsumedGasAmount`(s) values per time step (to account for multiple boilers and GT emitting emissions through same chimney)
3) Extract values for target `disp:SimulationTime`
4) Estimate emissions using emission factors from literature
    - Current focus on NO<sub>x</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> , and PM<sub>2.5</sub> only 
    (as NO<sub>2</sub> is currently not supported by Aermod, NO<sub>x</sub> is used interchangibly instead)
    - Treat flue gas stream as hot air (using flue gas temperatures from literature)


&nbsp;
# 3. Using the Agent

## 3.1 Building the Agent

To build and publish the agent Docker image, please use the following commands. Please note that both commands are bundled in the  `publish_docker_image.sh` convenience script.

```bash
# Building the (production) image
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml build
# Publish the Docker image to the Github container registry
docker image push ghcr.io/cambridge-cares/<image tag>:<version>
```

## 3.2 Deploying the Agent

It is recommended to pull the published Docker image from [Github container registry] for sole deployment (i.e., in case no modifications to the agent are needed):

```bash
# Pull published (production) image
docker pull ghcr.io/cambridge-cares/dh-emission-agent:1.1.0
```

###  **Standalone Deployment**

Deploy the dockerised agent by running the following command from the same location where this README is located (ideally, use a bash terminal to avoid potential issues with inconsistent path separators). 

```bash
# Deploy the Docker image locally
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

To verify the correct startup of the agent, open the URL address the agent is running on, e.g., `http://localhost:5001/` in your browser. 


### **Stack Deployment**

If you want to spin up this agent as part of a stack, do the following:
1) Build OR pull the (production) image using the commands provided above (do not spin up the image)
2) Copy the `dh-emission-agent.json` file from the [stack-manager-input-config] folder into the `inputs/config/services` folder of the stack manager (and add the service to the target stack config file in `inputs/config/`)
3) Start the stack manager as usual (i.e. `bash ./stack.sh start <STACK_NAME>` from the stack-manager repo). This should start the container. Please use a bash terminal to avoid potential issues with inconsistent path separators.
4) The agent shall become available at `http://<HOST>:<PORT>/DHEmissionAgent/`


## 3.3 Notes on Debugging

To debug the agent within the stack, follow these steps (a similar approach should work for the standalone version)

1) Overwrite command specified in Dockerfile by providing `tail -f /dev/null` `Command` in stack-manager config file (this keeps the container alive indefinitely while doing nothing). An amended `dh-emission-agent-debug` config is provided in the [stack-manager-input-config] folder.
2) Start stack-manager as usual
3) Right click on running agent container -> select "Attach Visual Studio Code"
4) Install required VSCode extensions inside the container (i.e., Python)
5) Start local debugging session inside container by running `entry_point.py` in debug mode
6) Follow instructions in [debug script] to create a new emission derivation in debug mode

**Please note**:
- This approach also works for already running agent containers; however, the port number in `entry_point.py` needs to be changed before starting a second agent instance for debugging
- After debugging, the instantiated agent URL needs to be reset to the original in case the non-debug agent instance is required again


&nbsp;
# 4. Dockerised Agent Tests

Both dockerised unit and integration tests are provided to check for expected behaviour of the emission estimation agents.

```bash
# Build and run dockerised agent tests
docker compose -f "docker-compose-test_dockerised.yml" up -d --build
```

To run the dockerised tests in Debug mode, please run the below command to start up the testing agent and pytest in debug mode. Subsequently, attach the Debugger(s) using the provided `Python: Debug dockerised tests` and `Python: Debug dockerised agent` configurations as required (provided in `.vscode` subfolder). Attaching the `Python: Debug dockerised tests` debugger is required to start the tests, while attaching the debugger to the agent is optional:

```bash
# Build and run dockerised agent tests in debug mode
docker compose -f "docker-compose-test_dockerised_debug.yml" up -d --build
```
