### Cr2(OAc)4 Synthesis
1. **Dissolve:** Dissolve 15 g of CrCl3·6H2O in 30 mL of 0.4 N sulfuric acid solution in a vessel 1, resulting in a dark green solution.
2. **Add:** Add 90 g of sodium acetate to 70 mL of H2O in a vessel 2.
3. **HeatChill:** Heat the solution in vessel 2 to boiling.
4. **Sonicate:** Bubble nitrogen through the boiling solution in vessel 2 for 30 minutes.
5. **Add:** Add the chromium solution from vessel 1 to 10 g of zinc powder in a vessel 3.
6. **Separate:** Subject vessel 3 to three vacuum/N2 backfill cycles to remove any oxygen above the solution.
7. **Stirr:** Stir the mixture in vessel 3 for 45 minutes until a deep blue solution is present.
8. **Transfer:** Dilute the deep blue solution in vessel 3 with 190 mL of degassed H2O via cannula transfer to a new vessel 4.
9. **Filter:** Rotate vessel 4 to allow the solution to filter through a fritted filter tube into the sodium acetate solution in vessel 2.
10. **Stirr:** Stir the mixture in vessel 2 overnight to ensure full precipitation of the product.
11. **Filter:** Filter the product through a fritted filter tube.
12. **Filter:** Wash the product with 3 x 20 mL degassed H2O.
