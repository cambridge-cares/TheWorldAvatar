# UK Building Retrofit

This repository provides a set of instructions for creating an interoperable environment to integrate UK-wide building energy performance, energy consumption, fuel poverty, and public health records. The use case is to quantify building retrofit urgency and determine optimal retrofit pathways across multiple geographic scales.

## Stack Deployment

The [StackDeployment] repository offers a detailed guide for deploying the complete Docker Stack tailored for the UK building retrofit use case. It provides an SPARQL endpoint for semantic representation and information extraction.


## Utilities

The [Utilities] repository features geospatial analysis models to identify energy consumption hotspots, an approach to assess retrofit urgency considering energy, socioeconomic, and health factors based on The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and a decision tree model for what-if analysis of fabric-first versus system-led retrofit improvements.
