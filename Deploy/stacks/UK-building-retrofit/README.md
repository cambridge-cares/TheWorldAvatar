# UK Building Retrofit

This repository provides a set of instructions for creating an interoperable environment to integrate UK-wide building energy performance, energy consumption, fuel poverty, and public health records. The use case is to quantify building retrofit urgency and determine optimal retrofit pathways across multiple geographic scales.

## Stack Deployment

The [StackDeployment] repository offers a detailed guide for deploying a [Docker] Stack tailored for the UK building retrofit use case. It provides an [SPARQL] endpoint for semantic representation and information extraction.


## Utilities

The [Utilities] repository contains geospatial analysis models to identify energy consumption [hotspots], an approach to assess retrofit urgency considering energy, socioeconomic, and health factors based on The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution ([TOPSIS]), and a [decision_tree_model] for what-if analysis of fabric-first versus system-led retrofit improvements.
