# [PHPExif v0.6.4](http://github.com/PHPExif/php-exif) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PHPExif/php-exif.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PHPExif/php-exif) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/PHPExif/php-exif/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/PHPExif/php-exif?branch=master)

PHPExif is a library which gives you easy access to the EXIF meta-data of an image.

PHPExif serves as a wrapper around some native or CLI tools which access this EXIF meta-data from an image. As such, it provides a standard API for retrieving and accessing that information.

## Supported tools

* Native PHP functionality (exif_read_data, iptcparse)
* [Exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool) adapter (wrapper for the exiftool binary)

## Installation (composer)

```json
composer require miljar/php-exif
```
