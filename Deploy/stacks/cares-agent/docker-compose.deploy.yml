# This configuration file should include all docker-compose options required to *deploy containers*
# for services in the 'agent' stack, with the exception of the 'ports' node which should be set in
# docker-compose.deploy.live.yml and docker-compose.deploy.test.yml (see those files for details).
#
# Options used to generate an image from source, such as the 'build' node and 'labels' node should
# be set in docker-compose.build.yml.
#
# When adding a new service, please copy the configuration for an existing service, then modify the 
# service name, the 'image' tag (retaining 'docker.cmclinnovations.com') and the 'container_name'
# node (retaining '${CONTAINER_NAME_SUFFIX}').
