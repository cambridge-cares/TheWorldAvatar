# Example Dataset Configurations

To use a dataset configuration copy the relevant file(s) from the `config` directory and the corresponding folder from the `data` directory into the matching directories in `stack-data-uploader/inputs`, and then add the geospatial data files as instructed in any `README.md` files that are present in the subdirectories.
