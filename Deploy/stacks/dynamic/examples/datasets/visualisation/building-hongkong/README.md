# Default Visualisation Configurations

After uploading the Hong Kong building data to the stack, three sets of b3dm files are generated by py3dtiler:

- LOD2 Buildings: Buildings with LoD2 are visualised.
- LOD2 Features: Roof, ground and wall surfaces of LoD2 buildings are visualised.
- LOD1-LOD2 Buildings: Buildings are shown as LoD1 when zoomed out and as LoD2 when zoomed in.

They can be visualised by the [TWA Visualisation Framework (TWA-VF) with Cesium](../../../../../../../web/twa-vis-framework/example-cesium-vis).

In addition, a Geoserver layer is published by the stack for visualisation in the [TWA Visualisation Framework (TWA-VF) with Mapbox](../../../../../../../web/twa-vis-framework/example-mapbox-vis).

Example data.json and settings.json are provided in this folder (User will need to register with [MapTiler](https://cloud.maptiler.com/) to get an API key for settings.json; otherwise no terrain elevation in the visualisation, buildings would appear to be floating in Cesium). Please read the README.md of the TWA-VF for instructions of spinning up the visualisation.
