Add Bavaria CityGML here from https://geodaten.bayern.de/opengeodata/OpenDataDetail.html?pn=lod2

You will need to zoom in sufficiently until selecting one of the square tiles pops up a download option

An ontop mapping for CityGML data is included. It is strongly recommended to make geometries available in CRS84 (the default for GeoSPARQL). It is explicitly stated in the OBDA file for clarity.
