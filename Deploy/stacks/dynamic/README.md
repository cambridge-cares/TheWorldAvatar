# TWA Stack Tools

## [The Stack Manager](./stack-manager)

The Stack Manager is a tool for configuring, spinning up, and connecting containers.
More details of the Stack Manager and instructions for using it can be found [here](./stack-manager/README.md).

## [The Stack Data Uploader](./stack-data-uploader)

The Stack Data Uploader is a tool for uploading data into a stack and making it available through various formats and interfaces.
More details of the Stack Data Uploader and instructions for using it can be found [here](./stack-data-uploader/README.md).

## [The Stack Clients Library](./stack-clients)

The Stack Clients library is a collection of Java code that provides APIs to interact with the containers.
Detailed documentation of these APIs is currently a work in progress.

It is also possible to wrap this using the py4j library to call them from Python code.
This has been done for several agents but still needs some work to make it standardised.

## [Examples](./examples/datasets)

Example datasets can be found [here](./examples/datasets).
They are also described in the Stack Data Uploader readme [here](./stack-data-uploader/README.md#example-datasets).
