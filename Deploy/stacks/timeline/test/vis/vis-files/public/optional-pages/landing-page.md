**Visualisation for TWA timeline data**

This visualisation is designed to display trajectories recorded using the TWA timeline app. Click "Explore" to view data, please sign in using the same account on the timeline app.

## Navigation

Buttons for navigation within the platform are available on the right side. While all buttons are generated from other optional markdown contents, the "Explore" and "Analyse" buttons will direct you to the map and dashboard tools, respectively. The "Analyse" button has been disabled in this sample.

For more information, please see the associated README file within the [TWA repository](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/web/twa-vis-platform) or contact the CMCL technical team.
