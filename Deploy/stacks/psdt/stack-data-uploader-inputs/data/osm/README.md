In QGIS, install the QuickOSM plug-in. Then, in the menu, select Vector -> QuickOSM -> QuickOSM. Use the dropdown boxes to pick key and value. Select an area, e.g. canvas extent, then run the query, and export the new layers (if any) as shape. Repeat this for the following, and put the resulting shape files into subfolders with those names of the present folder:
- power_lines_lines
- power_lines_points
- power_minor_lines_lines
- power_minor_lines_points
