# This configuration file should include any docker-compose options used only when deploying the
# stack in development ('dev') mode and not in production ('prod') mode.
# It can also include whole services that are only required in development mode, and therefore 
# aren't declared in docker-compose.deploy.yml .

# Its counterpart is docker-compose.prod.yml, although that file isn't necessarily required.
