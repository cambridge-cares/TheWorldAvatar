# This configuration file should include any docker-compose options used only when deploying the
# stack in development mode WITHOUT the '--test' flag (i.e. in normal running).
# Its counterpart is docker-compose.dev.test.yml.
#
# The expectation is that this file will contain 'ports' nodes for any services that need to map a
# host port, but other options may be valid too - please consult CMCL admins for more details.
# For guidance in setting an appropriate port number, please see the instructions at
# https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/wiki/Docker:-Stacks#instructions-1
