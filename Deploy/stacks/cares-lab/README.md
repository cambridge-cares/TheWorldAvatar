# CARES Digital Lab
This repository contains the instructions, directory structure, and configurations required to deploy the Lab stack. 

## 1. Preparations
### Knowledge of the stack tools adopted in The World Avatar
Please read through the [Stack Manager](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Deploy/stacks/dynamic/stack-manager) to set up your stack accordingly.

## 2. Deployment Workflow
### Stack manager
Recommended stack name: labStack

1) Add these secret files in [stack-manager-secrets]
    - geoserver_password
    - grafana_password
    - keycloak.conf (Download the file from https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wxhjxxwrwkuk9nr3kf6lv/keycloak.conf?rlkey=tdovr3higr2k25houanb7wbkk&st=pfvw5i0p&dl=0)
	- postgis_password
	- mapbox_username
	- mapbox_api_key

### HTTPS and domain
A domain is required for the lab stack. The current domain being utilized is https://careslab.theworldavatar.io. To set up HTTPS for this domain, refer to the guide listed here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tvrj0n0qkvfmuici07fzq/let-s-encrpt-with-certbot-guide.txt?rlkey=kmpkb478izk6qrb6admam4sfi&st=jf96zqyv&dl=0

### Keycloak
1. Navigate to [keycloak.json] and modify the following environment variables if necessary:
- KEYCLOAK_ADMIN 
- KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD
- JAVA_OPTS_APPEND - the trust store password can be modified if necessary

2. Navigate to the following dropbox folder and download the truststore.jks file:
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vnnrpz3gte71jpzew6kvu/truststore.jks?rlkey=664b2nykhx2af1qyuhknspwrl&st=q6ms2mco&dl=0

3. In the [keycloak.json] and under the `Mounts` section, modify `Source` based on the location of the truststore.jks file.

### Visualisation
1. Go to the following [dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/hztcpc0fxz2ql8jimsm3u/data.zip?rlkey=ejdv5e85l6gmfq7ka1zadxpae&st=7mua6kbp&dl=0) and download the `data` folder. It should contain the glb files for the lab visualisation.

2. Unzip the folder and extract the `data` folder to [webspace].

3. Navigate to [services], open [visualisation.json] and under the `Mounts` section, modify `Source` based on where [webspace] is located at.
