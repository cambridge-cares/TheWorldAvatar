# Digital Twin Visualisation Framework

A central framework for Digital Twin Visualisations (the Digital Twin Visualisation Framework, or DTVF) has been created so that in most cases, the process of creating a new visualisation to display pre-generated data is as simple as possible. The goal is that a developer that is inexperienced with Javascript (or the Javascript libraries we're using) can get a reasonable visualisation of the data by simply ensuring the data meets a set format and providing some basic metadata files.

For more details on the framework, see the [Digital Twin Visualisations](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/wiki/Digital-Twin-Visualisations) page on the GitHub wiki.
