            <h1>You've reached your NGINX container!</h1>
            <p>If you're seeing this content, you've reached the root of the the "url-testing" NGINX container.</p>
            <p>If you've followed the documentation and set your redirect target in the ".env" file, then you should be able to access your service and test your URLs <a href="./redirect">via this link</a>.</p>
            <p>In addition, there should also be an "example-service" container running locally to emulate an external service, you can access that directly via <a href="http://localhost:3000">this link</a>, or via it's own redirect <a href="./example">from this link.</a></p>
