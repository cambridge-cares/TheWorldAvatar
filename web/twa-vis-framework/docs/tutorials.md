# Tutorials

This page lists a variety of tutorials useful for developers thinking of working with the TWA-VF to develop new visualisations.

<br/>

## External tutorials

Before starting to work with the TWA-VF, it is worth reading the provided documentation (starting with the [Overview](./overview.md) page). After this, running through some of the non-TWA-VF examples provided by Mapbox and CesiumJS can help developers come to terms with general mapping concepts and the capabilities of each library.

A curated list of recommended external, non TWA-VF tutorials is shown below.

<br/>

**Mapbox:**
* [Add custom markers to a map with Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/custom-markers-gl-js-video/)
* [Get started with Mapbox GL JS expressions](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/mapbox-gl-js-expressions/)
* [Create interactive hover effects with Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/create-interactive-hover-effects-with-mapbox-gl-js/)

<br/>

**CesiumJS:**

Note that the tutorials provided by Cesium often contain Cesium ion API keys. These are fine to use for experimentation and feasibility studies, but cannot be used in TWA projects.

* [CesiumJS Quickstart](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs-learn/cesiumjs-quickstart/)
* [Visualize a Proposed Building in a 3D City](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs-learn/cesiumjs-interactive-building/)
* [Styling and Filtering 3D Tiles](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs-learn/cesiumjs-3d-tiles-styling/)

## TWA-VF tutorials

These tutorials show how to gather, host, and display data using the TWA-VF. Note that these tutorials may have been written using older versions of the TWA-VF; however, the major functionality should still stand.
