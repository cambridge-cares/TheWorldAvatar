**This example visualisation has been put together to demonstrate the intended use of the centralised TWA Visualisation Framework (TWA-VF).**

This framework has been designed to make it easier for users not experienced with Typescript (or the mapping libraries) to quickly & easily put 
together a new TWA visualisation. It is intended for developers to use this example visualisation to gain an understanding of the TWA-VF 
before attempting to create their own visualisation; to do that, this example can be copied and used as a starting point. Edit the markdown content in markdown syntax to suit your needs.

## Navigation

Buttons for navigation within the platform are available on the right side. While all buttons are generated from other optional markdown contents, the "Explore" and "Analyse" buttons will direct you to the map and dashboard tools, respectively. The "Analyse" button has been disabled in this sample.

For more information, please see the associated README file within the [TWA repository](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/web/twa-vis-platform) or contact the CMCL technical team.
