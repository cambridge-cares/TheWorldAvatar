# About CReDo

CReDo, the Climate Resilience Demonstrator, is a digital twin demonstrator project focuses on climate change adaptation with the aim of improving system-wide resilience across infrastructure networks. The project provides a practical example of how connected data and greater access to the right information can improve climate adaptation and resilience. It also demonstrates how to connect data across organizations to deliver efficiencies and wider societal benefits.

CReDo looks specifically at the impact of extreme weather, in particular flooding, on the energy, water and telecoms networks. It brings together asset data, flood hazard data and asset failure models to provide insights into infrastructure interdependencies and how they would be impacted by floods under future climate change scenarios.

The vision for CReDo is to enable asset owners, regulators, and policymakers to collaborate to make decisions that maximize resilience across the combined infrastructure system, as opposed to considering each sector independently, as is current practice. For example, consider a flood that has compromised assets from the energy network. This can have a knock-on impact on other sectors. However, the other networks might not be aware that they are vulnerable.

CReDo’s journey started back in 2017 with the publication of the report [Data for the Public Good](https://nic.org.uk/app/uploads/Data-for-the-Public-Good-NIC-Report.pdf) published by the National Infrastructure Commission in the UK. The report recommended the need for a demonstrator – a real working tool – to show the benefits that arise from sharing data across infrastructure sectors. CReDo was launched in March 2021 as a result of this recommendation. The project was launched by the [Centre for Digital Built Britain](https://www.cdbb.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge and the [Digital Twin Hub](https://digitaltwinhub.co.uk/credo). From March 22 onwards, it was taken forwards by the [Connected Places Catapult](https://cp.catapult.org.uk/) via funding from [Innovate UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk).

Going forward, CReDo has started to receive innovation funding from national regulators governing the energy and water markets in the UK with projects to look at the impact of extreme heat on cascading risk across the infrastructure networks. This is where an issue in one network causes knock-on effects in other networks. The potential impact of climate change on this type of cascading risk is an ongoing concern as highlighted in a recent [report from the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5803/jtselect/jtnatsec/132/report.html).
