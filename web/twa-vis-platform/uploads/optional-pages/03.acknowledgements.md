# Acknowledgements

CReDo has been delivered through a first-of-its-kind collaboration between academia, utilities networks, and government.

Collaborating on the first phase of CReDo were Anglian Water (AW), British Telecoms (BT), and UK Power Networks (UKPN), who used their asset and operations data as well as weather data supplied by the Met Office on a secure, shared basis to inform an increased level of infrastructure resilience. These data sets were securely shared to create a digital twin of the infrastructure system for energy, water and telecoms. This enabled insights from the data that can inform decision making concerning capital and operational planning and real time operations reducing the cost and disruptive impact of extreme weather events.

The second phase of CReDo also brought new partners into the project; Fathom, who provided additional weather data used to further improve climate resilience modelling, and Frontier Economics, who provided economic modelling used to estimate the financial impact of failure cascades across the wider infrastructure network.

CReDo was delivered through a collaboration of research centres (Universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Newcastle, and Warwick along with the Science and Technology Facilities Council, and the Joint Centre of Excellence in Environmental Intelligence) and industry, funded by BEIS, the Connected Places Catapult, and the University of Cambridge.
