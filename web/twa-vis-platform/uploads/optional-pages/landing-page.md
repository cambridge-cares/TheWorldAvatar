**The Climate Resilience Demonstrator (CReDo) is a pioneering climate change adaptation digital twin project that provides a practical example of how connected data can improve climate adaptation and resilience across a system of systems.**

The first phase of CReDo has demonstrated how collaboration through connected digital twins is key to tackling climate change. The project is making the move into its next phase, managed by Connected Places Catapult (CPC), with a series of outputs that will share key findings, benefits, lessons learned, and the technical approach to this first-of-its-kind collaboration.

## Why it's important

Climate change is a systemic challenge, and it demands a systems-based solution. CReDo shows the benefits of this joined up approach and how better information and coordination enables providers to identify better solutions. Collaboration through connected digital twins is key to tackling climate change.

CReDo provides an important template to build on. There is huge potential to adapt it to other challenges, such as climate mitigation and net zero. The end goal is building an ecosystem of connected digital twin.

## Where to start?

The CReDo platform offers a number of ways to visualise and analyse the interconnected infrastructure networks and their corresponding failure cascades under extreme weather scenarios. The buttons below can be used to view the most commonly used visualisation methods: the geospatial map of assets, and the analytics dashboard.

Additionally, a number of associated pages with more information about the CReDo project, how it was created, who was involved, and where it's going next, can be found to the right of the page.
