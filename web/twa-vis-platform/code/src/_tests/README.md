# Tests

This directory contains source code for [Jest unit tests](https://jestjs.io/); following the Next.js recommended project structure, it is prefixed with an underscore to denote that is a private, non-routable directory.

Test classes within this directory should match the same folder hierarchy as the corresponding source code.
