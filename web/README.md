This directory stores projects that are primarily web based, but are not Agents (as these are stored elsewhere). Visualisation projects, web-based scripts, and static web pages are ideal for storage here.

Older contents of this directory have been moved during a clean up in August 2023; anything moved is now located within the `/obsolete/web` directory.

# Documentation

Some useful documentation on creating web content better ready for deployment has been created and can be found within the [./docs](./docs) directory.
