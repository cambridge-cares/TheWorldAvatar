# Augmented UK

This visualisation provides a nation-wide view of a digital twin constructed to represent the real-world state of the United Kingdom (circa 2023). A number of real-world data sources have been used to populate the digital twin (see the "Attribution" page for details), providing both static and live data. Given the scale of the data, some of the layers are not shown by default to improve rendering performance and may require zooming in before they become visible.

It should be noted that this visualisation is one of many windows into the underlying knowledge model powered by [The World Avatar](https://theworldavatar.io). The World Avatar ingests and connects data from multiple sources in different formats and protocols in a semantically enhanced environment within the knowledge graph technology. Breaking down these disparate data silos through knowledge graphs enables greater interoperability between data sets, while providing contextualised meaning that aids the discovery of new insights across a wider scope. This digital twin has been employed as a template, or base world, to generate a number of hypothetical situations, or parallel worlds. These parallel worlds can then be used to explore the effects of possible scenarios (like worst-case climate change) through tweaks to their parameters in order to optimise existing asset networks.
