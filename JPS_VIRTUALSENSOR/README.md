## Prerequisites
1) Create 4 secrets file in `./stack-manager/inputs/secrets` with appropriate values in the files
    - geoserver_password
    - postgis_password
    - mapbox_api_key
    - mapbox_username
2) Set openweather API key in stack-manager/inputs/config/services/weather-agent.json, the API key needs to have OneCall enabled (credit card required, you can set the call limit below the limit before it starts charging).
3) If running AERMOD for static point sources, it is necessary to instantiate the input data required for AERMOD Agent according to OntoDispersion (https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/JPS_Ontology/ontology/ontodispersion). See the JurongIslandInputAgent folder for an example of an agent that does this.
4) Elevation data (optional):
AERMOD agent will try to query elevation data from a table named `elevation` in the default database. AERMOD agent can query the data stored in any SRID, but the table needs to contain data in one SRID only, hence it's recommended to convert any elevation data to a uniform SRID, e.g. 4326. An example is provided in [elevation.json]. Note that this config file is written for data in SRID=32632 and it needs to be changed according to your source data. The raw data files should be stored in `./stack-data-uploader/inputs/data/elevation`, any format supported by gdal should work, see https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html for more info.
5) Buildings data (optional for ships, compulsory for static point source use cases):
An example config file is given in [building-pirmasens.json], corresponding raw data should be populated in `stack-data-uploader/inputs/data/pirmasens_final_citygml`

## Static point source instantiation
An example of a static point source that emits NOx. It is compulsory to have density, mass flowrate and temperature, the units for these values must be in kg/m3, kg/s, and Kelvin respectively. The static point source needs to point to a building via `disp:hasOntoCityGMLCityObject` and needs to be present in ontop via the mapping [citydb.obda].

An instance can emit multiple pollutants, the class of pollutant ID needs to be one of the following:
- <https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontodispersion/NOx>
- <https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontodispersion/uHC>
- <https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontodispersion/CO>
- <https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontodispersion/SO2>
- <https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontodispersion/PM10>
- <https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontodispersion/PM2.5>
- <https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontodispersion/CO2>

## Important for visualisation if not deployed locally
Modify instances of `http://localhost:3838` in [data.json] to the external URL of where the stack is going to be deployed.

## Start up the stack

To start up the stack, execute
```
./startup.sh
```
in this folder to spin up pull docker images, spin up containers (using stack manager) and copy files into container volumes.

## HTTP requests 
A number of examples are prepared in the `HTTP requests` folder. Note that you need to install the humao.rest-client extension in VS code to run these files.

## Example 
### With ships (live data)
There is an option in ShipInputAgent to pull data from https://aisstream.io/, this functionality depends on the API being online. Once the connection is made to the API, ShipInputAgent will pull data from this API continuously, until it disconnects and should restart by itself.

- Obtain an API key from this service at https://aisstream.io/authenticate.
- Parameters relevant to this API are set in [ship-input-agent.json]
    1) USE_LIVE_DATA - if this is set to true, ShipInputAgent will start pulling data at startup time. If set to false, live updates can still be triggered by submitting a POST request to http://localhost:3838/ship-input-agent/live-server
    2) API_KEY - API key for aistream.io
    3) BOUNDING_BOXES - see https://aisstream.io/documentation 
    4) UPLOAD_INTERVAL_MINUTES - The interval where ShipInputAgent accumulates data from aistream.io before uploading to the data to KG, default is 10 minutes.

To trigger scheduled live simulations, an example is given in [mbs-live.http]. 
- Parameters:
    1) ewkt - Extended WKT literal for PostGIS
    2) nx - number of x cells
    3) ny - number of y cells
    4) z - height to simulate (multiple values can be provided)
    5) label - Text to show in the visualisation for users to select which simulation to display
    6) delayMinutes - Upon submitting the request, the duration to wait before executing a dispersion simulation
    7) intervalMinutes - Interval to execute dispersion calculations.

To stop a scheduled task, change the request to DELETE instead of POST.

### With ships (static data) 
This workflow calls the ShipInputAgent to add 1 timestep worth of data before triggering an update for AERMOD.
1) Make sure ShipInputAgent/data is populated with data.
2) Initialise a simulation, e.g. [plymouth.http], you should receive a response in the form of 
```
{"derivation": "http://derivation_1"}
```
record this derivation IRI.
3) To trigger an AERMOD simulation, execute [GenerateDataWithShips.http], be sure to replace the derivation IRI in the request from the response from the previous step.

### Without ships (only static point source)
1) Initialise a simulation, e.g. [pirmasens1.http], record derivation IRI in the response.
2) Make sure there is at least one static point source instantiated before triggering an AERMOD simulation and the representative building object is also present.
3) Execute [GenerateDataWithoutShips.http], be sure to enter derivation IRI in the request.

## Visualisation
Visualisation can be viewed at http://localhost:3838/visualisation (replace localhost if deployed elsewhere). Note that if buildings data is present in ontop, the visualisation may take a while to load because the first query takes time.
