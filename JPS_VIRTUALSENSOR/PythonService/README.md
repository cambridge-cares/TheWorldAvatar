    - "molmass"
    - "cp"
    - "temperature"
    - "density"
2) JSON array with the key "particle", each element in the array is a JSON object with the following keys
    - "density"
    - "emission_rate"
    - "diameter"
3) JSON array with the key "pollutants", each element in the array is a JSON object with the following keys
    - "name"
    - "value"

This route is called by the EmissionsAgent.
