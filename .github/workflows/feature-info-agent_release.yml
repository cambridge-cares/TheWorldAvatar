#
# This workflow contains a job that builds and pushes the Docker image
# for the FeatureInfoAgent, running its JUnit tests in the process.
#
# Note this workflow will use the automatically generated GITHUB_TOKEN
# and the username of the account that triggered it.
#
# Also note that the first time a Docker image is pushed by this workflow,
# it will be uploaded as a private image. You'll have to manually make
# it public using the controls on the GitHub website.
