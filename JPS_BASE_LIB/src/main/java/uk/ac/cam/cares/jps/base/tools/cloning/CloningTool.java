/**
 * This class implements a cloning tool for Triple Stores. 
 * ** DO NOT WITH QUADS **  
 * On large stores cloning is performed step-wise with an overlap between each step.
 * <p>
 * <b>How it works:</b>
 * The order of triples in a store (or the order of results returned by a SPARQL query)
 * is not fixed. This method assumes that there is, however, some level of 
 * ordered grouping of triples in a store. Thus, the store can be cloned by 
 * sequentially querying for groups of N triples in store using the OFFSET and LIMIT keywords.    
 * An overlap is applied to capture locally unordered triples at the boundary 
 * between two successive steps. While SPARQL does offer an ORDERBY keyword, sorting triples in 
 * a large store every step is a very slow process. This method avoids the need to explicitly sort
 * by exploiting the (assumed) internal data structure and order of the triple store.  
 * <p>
 * <b>Things to note and requirements:</b>
 * Note that cloning is a slow process and success is not guaranteed.
 * To avoid corruption of source data, the source store is only ever queried/read-only.  
 * The tool requires that the target store is initially empty and will otherwise fail
 * (unless this condition is {@link uk.ac.cam.cares.jps.base.tools.cloning.CloningTool#overrideEmptyTarget() overridden}
 * prior to starting the cloning process). <br>
 * The algorithm will attempt to increase the overlap if the initial overlap is too small.
 * The clone will fail and return an error after 5 failed attempts to adjust the overlap
 * or if the final number of triples in the target store does not match the number in the source store.
 * In case of failure, the user should clear the target store.     
 * <p>
 * <b>How to use the tool:</b> 
 * The simplest way to use the cloning tool is from a {@link uk.ac.cam.cares.jps.base.interfaces.TripleStoreClientInterface TripleStoreClientInterface} object with the methods
 * {@link uk.ac.cam.cares.jps.base.interfaces.TripleStoreClientInterface#cloneTo cloneTo} and
 * {@link uk.ac.cam.cares.jps.base.interfaces.TripleStoreClientInterface#cloneFrom cloneFrom}.
 * <br>
 * Alternatively, a CloningTool object can be instantiated. This allows control 
 * over the step size, overlap and to override the requirement for an empty 
 * target store. In this case the {@link uk.ac.cam.cares.jps.base.tools.cloning.CloningTool#clone clone}
 * method should be used to clone from the source to the target store.
