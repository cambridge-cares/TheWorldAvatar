 * TODO remove this class once we moved to Java 11 and upgraded to rdf4j-sparqlbuilder>=4.0.0
 * This is a workaround for the SparqlBuilder library.
 * The BIND clause is added since their 4.0.0 release, which requires minimum Java 11.
 * Given the jps-base-lib is still Java 8, the clause is implemented here.
 * For more information, see:
