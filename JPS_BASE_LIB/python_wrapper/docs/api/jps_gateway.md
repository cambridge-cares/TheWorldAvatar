> **`JPSGateway` is the parent class which should be instantiated by every resource gateway class**.

> The resource gateway class is automatically created upon the resource installation, whose class name is the same as the name of the resource given during the installation.

> Therefore, **one should ideally only work with the resource classes, e.g. `JpsBaseLib`, rather than with the parent `JPSGateway` class**.
