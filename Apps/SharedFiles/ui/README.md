# UI

This folder contains the TWA theme files and predefined dimensions for spacing and font sizes for a consistent look and feel across TWA mobile applications. The TWA theme is generated with [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/) and exported as a Material3 theme. This tool allows for easy regeneration and updates of theme colors. 

To maintain a standardized color style across your app, we recommend using the theme colors provided and applying theme overlays on widgets. This approach helps ensure uniformity and a cohesive user experience throughout the application.
