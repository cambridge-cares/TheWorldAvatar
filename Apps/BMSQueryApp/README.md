## Development Setup
All agents and database should be deployed in a server with local [stack](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Deploy/stacks/dynamic/stack-manager), and the app acts as a standalone frontend. This section is aimed for local development setup.

Agents required:
- [FeatureInfoAgent](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Agents/FeatureInfoAgent)
- [BMSQueryAgent](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Agents/BMSQueryAgent)
- [BMSUpdateAgent](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Agents/BMSWriteAgent)

### Feature Info Agent Configuration
Before launching Feature Info Agent in the stack, config files need to be copied into the feature info agent folder. Copy all `.sparql` files in `feature-info-agent-queries/` to `TheWorldAvatar/Agent/FeatureInfoAgent/queries`.

Create `FeatureInfoAgent/queries/fia-config.json` if not exsits. Then append the queries section in `feature-info-agent-queries/fia-config.json` to `FeatureInfoAgent/queries/fia-config.json`.

More information about FeatureInfoAgent configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/Agents/FeatureInfoAgent#configuration).

### Endpoints configuration
Update the endpoints and IRIs in `Apps/BMSQueryApp/app/src/main/res/values/configs.xml`. The host configuration should contains scheme, domain amd port number.

### Authentication
This app uses [AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android) to communicate with OpenID Connect providers.

1. Register app client in Keycloak as OpenID Connect type client. Check [here](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/23.0.4/server_admin/#_oidc_clients) for complete setup guide. The app isn't a resource client, so no authorization is needed to setup.
2. Replace `<identity_provider_addr>` with the stack address in Apps/BMSQueryApp/app/src/main/res/raw/auth_config.json
