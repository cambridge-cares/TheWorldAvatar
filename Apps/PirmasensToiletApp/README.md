## Mapbox token

Your mapbox token should be in [`settings.gradle`](./gradle.properties) and also [`developer-config.xml`](./core/utils/src/main/res/values/developer-config.xml). 

## Phone and Stack communication
If you are running on emulator use `HOST_LOCALHOST` in `NetworkConfiguration.java`, otherwise you should have android and stack on same network. You can use `ipconfig` or other related commands to find the ip address of your pc.
